In November 2022, **FTX**—the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange with a $32 billion valuation—collapses in spectacular fashion, revealing massive fraud and triggering cascading failures across the industry.

## The Unraveling

**November 2, 2022**: CoinDesk publishes report revealing Alameda Research's balance sheet is heavily concentrated in FTT (FTX's token)

**November 6**: Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announces plans to liquidate FTT holdings

**November 8**: $6 billion in withdrawal requests; FTX halts withdrawals

**November 9**: Binance announces acquisition, then backs out after due diligence

**November 11**: **FTX files for bankruptcy**

- $8+ billion in customer funds missing
- Commingling of customer assets with Alameda Research
- No segregation of funds despite representations

**November 12**: FTX hacked for $400M+ in remaining assets

**December 12**: Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas

## The Scale of Fraud

- **Misappropriated funds**: ~$8 billion
- **Creditors**: Over 1 million
- **Alameda loans**: FTX lent customer funds to sister company Alameda Research
- **Real estate purchases**: $300M+ in Bahamas properties using customer funds
- **Political donations**: $40M+ in campaign contributions
- **"Effective Altruism"**: SBF's public persona as ethical billionaire

## Industry Impact

**Cascading Failures:**

- BlockFi files for bankruptcy
- Genesis Trading halts withdrawals
- Crypto lending platforms collapse
- Venture funds with FTX exposure face redemptions

**Regulatory Response:**

- SEC charges against SBF for fraud
- CFTC files complaint for violations
- Congressional hearings on crypto oversight
- Accelerated push for clear regulatory frameworks

## The Trial

In November 2023, SBF is convicted on all seven counts:

- Wire fraud on customers
- Wire fraud on lenders
- Conspiracy to commit fraud
- Conspiracy to commit money laundering

Sentence: **25 years in federal prison** (March 2024)

## Lessons Learned

The FTX collapse reinforced critical principles:

> "Not your keys, not your coins"

- **Proof-of-reserves** became industry standard
- **Audits** by reputable firms now expected
- **Regulatory clarity** demanded by industry
- **Self-custody** tools gained renewed focus
- **Separation of trading/custody** recognized as essential

FTX's failure marked the end of crypto's "move fast and break things" era and the beginning of institutional-grade compliance and transparency standards.
