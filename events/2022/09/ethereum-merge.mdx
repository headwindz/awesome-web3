On September 15, 2022, Ethereum completed The Merge, switching its consensus from proof of work to proof of stake without interrupting the chain. The upgrade combined the long running Beacon Chain with the execution layer, effectively replacing the engine mid flight while preserving all history and state.

The outcomes were immediate. Energy usage fell by about 99.95 percent, and issuance dropped by roughly 90 percent, reshaping Ethereum's economics. The validator set grew large and geographically diverse, and finality became faster and more explicit.

What changed:

- Consensus moved from miners to validators.
- Energy consumption collapsed.
- Issuance declined and often turned net deflationary when activity was high.

What did not change was just as important: gas fees and block times stayed roughly the same, and the user facing experience barely moved. The Merge proved that a major public chain could execute a high risk transition through years of testing and coordination, and it set the stage for later scaling upgrades.
