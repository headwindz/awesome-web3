On August 8, 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash smart contracts, and Dutch authorities arrested developer Alexey Pertsev. It was the first major U.S. sanctions action targeting open-source code itself.

Regulators cited laundering by North Korea's Lazarus Group, while critics argued sanctioning code punishes legitimate privacy use. The hosted interface disappeared and providers blocked access, but the immutable contracts kept running.

Why it mattered:

- Tested boundary between privacy tools and national security
- Exposed DeFi's dependence on centralized infrastructure
- Created legal chilling effect for privacy developers

## The Core Conflict

**Government Position:**

- Privacy tools enable crime (North Korea, ransomware)
- Code can be a national security threat
- Developers responsible for misuse

**Privacy Advocates:**

- Code is free speech
- Immutable contracts can't be stopped
- Punishing developers violates due process
- Legitimate privacy users hurt

## What Happened

**2022:** Sanctions, Pertsev arrested  
**2023:** Trial delayed, legal challenges filed  
**2024:** Pertsev convicted, sentenced to 64 months, appeals ongoing

Still no legal clarity on whether code = speech or whether developers are liable for user actions.

## The Irony

Government sanctioned code it can't stop, arrested developer who can't control it, and created martyr for privacy cause. Tornado Cash still works. Pertsev is in prison. Nothing actually stopped.

**The lesson:** Immutable doesn't mean unstoppable. Governments can imprison developers and scare users, but can't kill the code. Privacy lives in shadows, technically available but legally persecuted. The real question remains unanswered: Is code speech or a weapon?
