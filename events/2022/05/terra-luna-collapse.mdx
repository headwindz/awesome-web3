In May 2022, **Terra (LUNA)** and its algorithmic stablecoin **UST** experience a catastrophic death spiral, wiping out over **$40 billion** in market value in less than a week. The collapse triggers widespread contagion across crypto markets and destroys faith in algorithmic stablecoins.

## The Terra Ecosystem

**What Was Terra?**

- Layer 1 blockchain founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin
- Native token: LUNA
- Algorithmic stablecoin: UST (TerraUSD)
- Peaked at $40B+ market cap (3rd largest crypto by market cap)

**The Mechanism:**

UST maintained its $1 peg through an algorithmic relationship with LUNA:

- To mint 1 UST: Burn $1 worth of LUNA
- To redeem 1 UST: Burn UST, receive $1 worth of LUNA
- Arbitrage opportunities supposedly kept UST at $1

**Anchor Protocol:**

- DeFi protocol offering **20% APY** on UST deposits
- Primary use case driving UST demand
- Yield funded by Terra Foundation reserves (unsustainable)

## The Death Spiral

**May 7-8, 2022:** Large UST withdrawals from Curve liquidity pool

- $2B+ UST dumped
- UST loses peg, drops to $0.985
- Panic begins

**May 9:** The spiral accelerates

- UST drops to $0.60
- Users rush to redeem UST for LUNA
- LUNA supply inflates massively (from 350M to 6.5 trillion tokens)
- LUNA price crashes from $80 to under $1

**May 10-11:** Total collapse

- UST: $0.10-0.30
- LUNA: $0.0001
- Terra blockchain halted
- **$40 billion evaporated**

## The Casualties

**Direct Losses:**

- Retail investors: Billions in life savings
- Three Arrows Capital: $200M+ loss (led to their bankruptcy)
- Jump Crypto: $300M+ loss trying to defend peg
- Terraform Labs reserves: $3B+ Luna Foundation Guard spent

**Contagion:**

- Celsius Network exposed (contributed to June collapse)
- Voyager Digital exposed
- BlockFi exposed
- Credit drying up across crypto

## The Aftermath

**Do Kwon's Response:**

- Proposes "Terra 2.0" without algorithmic stablecoin
- Community fork: LUNA Classic (LUNC) and Terra Classic (USTC)
- Eventually goes on the run from authorities

**Legal Consequences:**

- SEC charges Do Kwon and Terraform Labs (February 2023)
- Interpol red notice issued
- Do Kwon arrested in Montenegro (March 2023)
- Extradition battle between US and South Korea ongoing
- Criminal fraud charges in multiple jurisdictions

**Regulatory Impact:**

- Renewed scrutiny of stablecoins
- Algorithmic stablecoins largely abandoned
- Push for reserve-backed stablecoin regulation
- Highlights risks of unsustainable yields

## What Went Wrong?

**Fundamental Flaws:**

1. **Ponzi Economics:**

   - 20% APY unsustainable
   - Depended on constant new money
   - Anchor reserves depleting

2. **Death Spiral Design:**

   - No circuit breakers
   - Positive feedback loop
   - One-way bet on growth

3. **Insufficient Collateral:**

   - Luna Foundation Guard reserves inadequate
   - Couldn't defend peg under selling pressure

4. **Hubris:**
   - Do Kwon's dismissive attitude toward critics
   - "I don't debate the poor" tweets
   - Overconfidence in mechanism

## Lessons Learned

**For Crypto:**

- Algorithmic stablecoins are extremely fragile
- Unsustainable yields = unsustainable projects
- Market cap ≠ real value
- Hubris and arrogance are red flags

**For Investors:**

- If it seems too good to be true, it is
- Understand the mechanisms behind your investments
- Don't put all eggs in one basket
- High APY = high risk

**For Regulators:**

- Stablecoins need proper oversight
- Reserve requirements matter
- Consumer protection is necessary

The Terra/LUNA collapse stands as crypto's Lehman Brothers moment—a systemically important failure that exposed interconnected risks and triggered cascading liquidations. It destroyed the "algorithmic stablecoin" narrative and reminded everyone that in crypto, as in traditional finance, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
