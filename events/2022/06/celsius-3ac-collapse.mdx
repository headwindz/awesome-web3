On June 13, 2022, **Celsius Network froze withdrawals** for its 1.7 million users, followed days later by the revelation that **Three Arrows Capital (3AC)** was insolvent with billions in losses—triggering a **cascade of bankruptcies** across crypto lending platforms and marking the **true beginning** of the 2022 bear market.

## The Setup: Unsustainable Yields

**How Did We Get Here?**

**2020-2021 Bull Market:**

- DeFi yields: 10-20% APY
- Lending platforms: Competing aggressively
- **Celsius**: "Unbank yourself" narrative
- **BlockFi, Voyager, Nexo**: Similar models
- **Institutions**: Levered up via 3AC, Alameda

**The Celsius Model:**

- Deposit crypto, earn **yield** (8-18% APY)
- Celsius lends to **institutions**
- Users can borrow against deposits
- **No KYC** in early days
- CEO Alex Mashinsky: "We're not a bank, we're better"

**The Promise:**

> "Banks keep 80% of profits. We give 80% to our community."

**The Reality:**

Yield came from:

- Risky DeFi strategies
- Lending to over-leveraged hedge funds (3AC)
- GBTC arbitrage trade
- Ponzi-like new deposits covering old yields

## Three Arrows Capital: The Leverage Kings

**Who Was 3AC?**

- **Founded 2012**: Kyle Davies, Su Zhu
- **Singapore-based** hedge fund
- **Billions under management**
- Invested in: GBTC, LUNA, Ethereum, Solana, NFTs
- **Reputation**: Crypto smartest money

**The Leverage:**

3AC borrowed from **everyone**:

- Celsius
- BlockFi
- Genesis
- Voyager
- Deribit
- FTX

**The Bets:**

1. **GBTC arbitrage**: Borrowed BTC, bought GBTC at premium
2. **LUNA**: $200M+ investment (went to zero)
3. **Staked ETH**: Locked until Ethereum Merge
4. **Solana**: Large positions at $200+ (crashed to $10)
5. **Real estate**: Singapore mansions

All leveraged **10-20x**.

## The Collapse Begins

**Timeline:**

**May 9, 2022**: Terra/LUNA collapses

- 3AC held $200M+ in LUNA
- Went to **zero**
- 3AC lost ~$500M instantly

**May-June 2022**: Crypto crashed

- Bitcoin: $48k → $18k (-62%)
- Ethereum: $3,500 → $900 (-74%)
- Altcoins: -80% to -95%
- **Leveraged positions liquidated**

**June 8, 2022**: Celsius slows withdrawals

- "Network congestion" excuse
- Reality: Liquidity crisis

**June 13, 2022**: Celsius **freezes all withdrawals**

## The Celsius Death Spiral

**What Went Wrong:**

1. **GBTC Trade**:

   - Celsius bought GBTC at premium
   - Premium turned to **40% discount**
   - Trapped billions in underwater position

2. **stETH Depeg**:

   - Celsius held stETH (staked ETH)
   - stETH depegged to 0.93 ETH
   - Liquidity crisis: Can't sell without huge loss

3. **Bad Loans**:

   - Lent to 3AC, other hedge funds
   - Not getting repaid
   - Users demanding withdrawals

4. **Ponzi Dynamics**:
   - New deposits funding old yields
   - Withdrawals > deposits
   - Death spiral begins

**The Bank Run:**

- May-June: **$800M+ withdrawn**
- Celsius scrambling for liquidity
- Trying to sell assets at worst time
- Can't meet obligations

**June 13: Nuclear Option:**

- **Freeze withdrawals** (pause all transactions)

## The Three Arrows Collapse

**Kyle Davies & Su Zhu:**

Two **arrogant bros** who:

- Leveraged billions
- Bet wrong on LUNA
- Doubled down on falling markets
- Ignored margin calls

**The Exposure:**

3AC owed to:

- **Voyager**: $650M
- **Genesis**: $2.3B
- **BlockFi**: $1B+
- **Celsius**: Hundreds of millions
- **Deribit**: $400M

Total: **$10B+ in losses** across the industry.

**The Victims:**

Every CeFi platform that lent to 3AC faced:

- Massive losses
- Liquidity crisis
- User panic
- Potential bankruptcy

## The Contagion Spreads

- **Unchained Capital**: Bitcoin-only, conservative

## The Alex Mashinsky Saga

**Who Is Alex Mashinsky?**

- **Celsius founder/CEO**
- Serial entrepreneur
- **Prolific promoter**: "Banks are not your friends"
- Promised impossible yields
- **Sociopath vibes** (in retrospect)

**The Red Flags:**

1. **Withdrew his own crypto** before freeze
2. **Sold CEL token** at peak
3. **Lied about yields** being sustainable
4. **Compared himself** to Apple, Amazon
5. **Blamed users** for panic

**The Criminal Charges (2023):**

- Wire fraud
- Securities fraud
- Market manipulation
- Arrested July 2023
- Facing decades in prison

**The Quote That Aged Like Milk:**

> "We are not a bank. Banks keep your money. We give it back with interest. You are the bank."

Narrator: _They kept the money._

## The Kyle Davies & Su Zhu Disappearance

**As 3AC Collapsed:**

- **Stopped answering calls** from creditors
- **Deleted tweets** (too late, archived)
- **Fled Singapore** before liquidators arrived
- **Su Zhu**: Went to Dubai
- **Kyle Davies**: Unknown location

**The Arrogance:**

**Before collapse, Su Zhu tweeted:**

> "We are three months from bankruptcy. No big deal. We'll be fine."

Narrator: _They were not fine._

**The Blame Game:**

Instead of taking responsibility:

- Blamed **Terra/LUNA** collapse
- Blamed **market conditions**
- Blamed **creditors** for calling loans
- Never said "sorry"

**The Liquidation:**

- **Court-ordered liquidation**
- Assets worth **fraction** of debts
- Creditors recovered **pennies on dollar**
- Kyle & Su kept luxury assets

## The User Impact

**Real People Hurt:**

- **$8B+ locked** in Celsius alone
- Life savings **frozen**
- Retirement accounts **gone**
- People refinanced houses to invest
- Suicides reported

**The Stories:**

- Man lost $2M (entire net worth)
- Family lost college fund ($150k)
- Retiree lost life savings ($400k)
- Small business lost operating capital

**The Bankruptcy Process:**

- **Years-long** recovery process
- **Lawyers get millions**
- Users might get **30-50 cents** on dollar
- Some get nothing
- Took 2+ years

## What They Were Doing With Your Money

**Celsius's Actual Strategy:**

Not "lending to businesses" like claimed. Actually:

1. **DeFi farming**: Risky leveraged yield strategies
2. **stETH**: Locked in illiquid positions
3. **GBTC arbitrage**: Trapped at losses
4. **Loans to 3AC**: Never getting repaid
5. **Mining operations**: Inefficient, underwater

All while paying **18% yields** to users. Math didn't work.

**3AC's Strategy:**

1. **Borrow at 8%** from platforms
2. **Invest in altcoins** yielding nothing
3. **Hope price goes up** forever
4. **Leverage 20x**
5. **Ignore risk management**

This is not a strategy. This is **gambling**.

## The Regulatory Response

**SEC & CFTC:**

- **Criminal charges** against Mashinsky
- **Civil suits** against Celsius
- **Probe into 3AC** (ongoing)
- **Unregistered securities** claims

**What Changed:**

1. **CeFi yield platforms**: Heavily scrutinized
2. **Lending regulations**: Much stricter
3. **Proof of reserves**: Demanded by users
4. **Disclosure requirements**: Increased
5. **Self-custody**: Narrative strengthened

**The Warning:**

> "Not your keys, not your coins"

Never more true.

## The Irony

**Celsius's Tagline:**

"Unbank yourself"

**What Happened:**

Celsius did **exactly** what banks do:

- Took deposits
- Made risky loans
- Over-leveraged
- Went insolvent
- Users couldn't withdraw

But **without** bank regulations, insurance, or bailouts.

**The Lesson:**

If it acts like a bank, it should be regulated like a bank.

## The DeFi vs CeFi Debate

**Why DeFi Survived:**

- **Transparent**: On-chain, auditable
- **Liquidations worked**: Automatically
- **No counterparty risk**: Smart contracts
- **No fraud**: Code does what it says
- **Self-custody**: Users keep control

**Why CeFi Failed:**

- **Opaque**: Off-chain, trust-based
- **Hidden risks**: No one knew 3AC exposure
- **Counterparty risk**: Celsius, 3AC can lie
- **Fraud possible**: And it happened
- **Custodial**: Platform holds keys

**The Verdict:**

DeFi had **Black Thursday** (2020) but recovered.
CeFi had **Celsius/3AC** (2022) and many died.

Transparency > Promises.

## The Numbers

**Celsius:**

- **$8B+ frozen** in customer assets
- **1.7 million users** affected
- **$4.7B shortfall** in bankruptcy
- **18% yields** promised (unsustainable)

**Three Arrows Capital:**

- **$10B+ losses** across creditors
- **$3B AUM** at peak
- **$200M LUNA loss** (catalyst)
- **20x leverage** in some positions

**Contagion Total:**

- **$20B+ losses** across CeFi platforms
- **Millions of users** affected
- **4+ companies** bankrupt
- **Years to recover** funds

## The Quotes

**Alex Mashinsky (Before):**

> "Celsius is the bank of the future. We will never freeze withdrawals."

**Alex Mashinsky (After):**

> "..."

(Arrested, facing 30+ years in prison)

**Su Zhu:**

> "It's frustrating that people don't understand what we're doing. We're generational investors."

Narrator: _They lost a generation's worth of money._

**Anonymous Celsius User:**

> "I trusted Alex. I believed the 'unbank yourself' story. I lost everything. I'll never forgive myself."

**Crypto Twitter:**

> "Not your keys, not your coins. How many times do we have to teach you this lesson?"

## The Long-Term Impact

**What Died:**

- **CeFi yield platforms**: Model discredited
- **"Unbanking" narrative**: Revealed as scam
- **Institutional trust**: Hedge funds seen as reckless
- **Altcoin season**: Risk-off sentiment
- **Leverage culture**: De-risking across industry

**What Survived:**

- **DeFi**: Transparent, code-based
- **Self-custody**: "Not your keys" validated
- **Bitcoin**: Least affected by contagion
- **Regulated exchanges**: Coinbase, Kraken fine
- **Conservative strategies**: Rewarded

**The Cultural Shift:**

From: "Trust us, we're experts"
To: "Verify, don't trust"

## Why It Matters

**Celsius/3AC Was Pivotal Because:**

1. **Exposed CeFi fraud**: Opaque systems failed
2. **Validated self-custody**: DeFi narrative strengthened
3. **Regulatory catalyst**: SEC cracked down
4. **Bear market trigger**: Contagion spread
5. **Humility lesson**: Even "smart money" can be dumb

**The Comparison:**

- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Banks bailed out
- **2022 Crypto Crisis**: No bailouts, users lost everything

This is **both** crypto's strength (no moral hazard) and weakness (no safety net).

**The Lesson:**

> "High yields = high risk. If it sounds too good to be true, it is."

Celsius promised **18% risk-free**. Turns out it was **100% risk**.

The market taught this lesson the hard way. 🔥💸
