In June and July 2022, crypto lending and brokerage firms toppled in rapid succession. Celsius froze withdrawals, Three Arrows Capital defaulted on billions in loans, and Voyager filed for bankruptcy. The collapses exposed how tightly connected the industry had become through opaque leverage.

The sequence mattered. After Terra's failure, markets slid and lenders faced withdrawals. Celsius could not unwind illiquid positions fast enough. 3AC, a marquee hedge fund, had borrowed from nearly every major lender and could not meet margin calls. Voyager was then forced into bankruptcy after a massive unsecured loan to 3AC went bad.

Contagion in practice:

- Lenders were also borrowers, so one failure impaired many balance sheets.
- High advertised yields hid concentrated risk and thin liquidity.
- Customers, not equity holders, bore most of the losses.

The episode pulled the curtain back on centralized yield platforms and set the stage for more failures later in 2022. It also revived a simple rule of the market: if returns look bank-like but operate like a hedge fund, the hidden leverage will eventually surface.
