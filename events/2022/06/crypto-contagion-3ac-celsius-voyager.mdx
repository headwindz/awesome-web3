In June-July 2022, the crypto industry experiences **cascading failures** as over-leveraged institutions domino into bankruptcy. **Three Arrows Capital (3AC)**, **Celsius Network**, and **Voyager Digital** all collapse within weeks, freezing withdrawals and trapping billions in customer funds.

## The Cascade

### **Week 1: Celsius Freezes Withdrawals (June 13)**

Celsius Network, a centralized lending platform with **$20 billion in assets**, suddenly halts all withdrawals:

- 1.7 million users affected
- "Acting in the best interest of our community" notice
- Claimed to offer 17% yields on deposits
- Reality: Insolvent, over-leveraged in DeFi

**What Went Wrong:**

- Deposited user funds into risky DeFi protocols
- Significant exposure to LUNA/UST collapse (May 2022)
- Staked ETH locked until Merge
- Used customer deposits for uncollateralized loans
- $1.2 billion hole in balance sheet

### **Week 2: Three Arrows Capital Liquidations (June 15-29)**

3AC, an elite crypto hedge fund managing **$10 billion+**, receives margin calls it can't meet:

**Founded by:**

- Su Zhu and Kyle Davies
- Once crypto's most respected investors
- Backed by Sequoia, Temasek

**The Unraveling:**

- $600M+ losses on LUNA
- Over-leveraged GBTC positions
- Borrowed from everyone, no collateral
- Assets worth 90% less than liabilities
- Founders ghost lenders, flee to Dubai

**Counterparty Exposure:**

- BlockFi: $1B+ exposure
- Genesis: $2.4B exposure
- Voyager: $650M exposure
- Dozens of other lenders

### **Week 3: Voyager Digital Files Bankruptcy (July 5)**

Voyager, a crypto brokerage with **3.5 million users**, files Chapter 11:

- $650 million loaned to 3AC (unsecured)
- 3AC defaults completely
- $1.3 billion in customer assets frozen
- Stock crashes from $25 to $0.10

## Why This Mattered

**Systemic Risk Revealed:**

Before: "DeFi is transparent, CeFi is risky"
After: "Everything is connected, transparency is an illusion"

**The Problems:**

1. **Opacity:** No one knew counterparty exposure
2. **Leverage:** Everyone borrowed from everyone
3. **Yield Addiction:** Unsustainable rates normalized
4. **No Regulation:** No capital requirements, no oversight
5. **Contagion:** One failure cascaded to many

## The Casualties

**Celsius Network:**

- Filed bankruptcy July 13
- $5.5 billion hole
- Founder Alex Mashinsky arrested (2023)
- Criminal fraud charges
- Customers recovering ~70% (2024)

**Three Arrows Capital:**

- Liquidated by creditors
- Founders fled Singapore
- Assets seized globally
- Bankruptcy in British Virgin Islands
- Investigations ongoing

**Voyager Digital:**

- Acquired by Binance.US (deal fell through)
- Eventually acquired by FTX (FTX then collapsed!)
- Finally acquired by Binance.US (2023)
- Partial customer recovery

**BlockFi:**

- Survived 3AC with $400M FTX bailout
- Collapsed when FTX collapsed (November 2022)
- Ironic: Rescued by entity that killed them

## Broader Market Impact

**Bitcoin:** $69K (November 2021) → $17.6K (June 2022)
**Ethereum:** $4.8K → $880
**Total Crypto Market Cap:** Lost $2 trillion

**Psychological:**

- "Crypto winter" deepens
- Retail investors flee
- Institutional interest pauses
- "Not your keys, not your coins" proved again

## Lessons Learned

**For Users:**

1. Centralized platforms = trust required
2. High yields = high risk
3. "Too big to fail" doesn't exist in crypto
4. Self-custody is the only custody

**For Industry:** 5. Transparency is not optional 6. Leverage kills 7. Interconnectedness is dangerous 8. Bear markets expose fraud

**For Regulators:** 9. Oversight needed 10. Customer protection matters 11. Capital requirements have purpose

## The Survivors

**Who Made It:**

- Coinbase (public, regulated)
- Kraken (conservative)
- Binance (huge reserves)
- Gemini (walled garden)

## The Legal Aftermath

**Criminal Charges:**

- Alex Mashinsky (Celsius): Fraud, arrested July 2023
- Multiple lawsuits against 3AC founders
- SEC investigations of all entities

**Customer Recovery:**

- Celsius: ~70% recovery expected (2024-2025)
- Voyager: ~30-50% recovery
- 3AC: Virtually nothing

## Historical Context

This wasn't the first contagion:

- **2014**: Mt. Gox collapse
- **2022**: Terra, 3AC, Celsius, Voyager
- **2022**: FTX (November)

But it was the first **systemic** contagion—multiple major institutions failing due to interconnected exposure.

## The Silver Lining

The contagion, painful as it was, **cleaned out** the industry:

- Zombie companies died
- Ponzi schemes exposed
- Leverage reduced
- Risk management improved
- Survivors became stronger

By 2024, the institutions that made it through were battle-tested, better capitalized, and more transparent. The weak hands were shaken out. The foundations were stronger.

Sometimes the best thing for an industry is a brutal near-death experience. Crypto got one in 2022.
