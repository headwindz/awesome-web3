On November 6, 2017, a user accidentally triggered a bug in Parity's multisig wallet library, freezing **513,774 ETH** across 587 wallets. The funds were locked permanently, a brutal reminder that smart-contract mistakes can be irreversible.

Parity's multisig wallets relied on a shared library contract. Because the library had never been properly initialized, a user known as **devops199** was able to claim ownership and then call a self-destruct function. The library vanished, and every wallet that depended on it stopped working instantly. No keys were stolen, but the ETH was frozen forever.

The loss was massive even at 2017 prices: roughly $280 million, with a notional value that would rise into the billions as ETH appreciated. It hit projects like Parity Technologies and the Polkadot ICO treasury, amplifying the controversy.

Parity pushed **EIP-999**, a proposal to recover the funds via a hard fork. The community rejected it, citing moral hazard and the precedent set by the DAO fork a year earlier. The decision established a sharper line: Ethereum would not reverse bugs that didn't involve theft.

The Parity freeze became a permanent case study in smart-contract risk. It accelerated demand for audits, formal verification, safer wallet patterns, and clearer governance decisions around when intervention is acceptable. In crypto, a single line of code can lock away fortunes, and there is no undo button.
