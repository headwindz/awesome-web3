In December 2017, **CBOE** and **CME** launched the first regulated Bitcoin futures, bringing Wall Street into crypto just as BTC topped near $20,000. The timing sparked a long debate about whether futures helped mark the peak.

CBOE went first on December 10 with the XBT contract, followed by CME on December 18 with a larger, more liquid product. Both were **cash-settled**, meaning no physical Bitcoin changed hands. For institutions, this was a breakthrough: they could gain exposure or hedge without dealing with custody, wallets, or unregulated exchanges.

Futures also made it easier to short Bitcoin. That new ability coincided with the market rolling over. Within weeks of the CME launch, Bitcoin fell sharply, beginning the 2018 bear market. Some argued futures enabled sustained shorting and accelerated the decline. Others pointed out the market was already in a classic bubble and would have crashed regardless.

Regardless of causality, the launch was a milestone. It legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class, introduced regulated price discovery, and paved the way for an expanding derivatives ecosystem. CBOE eventually exited, but CME became the dominant regulated venue, later adding micro contracts and Ethereum futures. The futures era didn't end Bitcoin's volatility, but it marked crypto's first real bridge into traditional finance.
