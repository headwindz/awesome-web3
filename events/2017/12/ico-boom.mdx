In 2017, crypto went supernova. Bitcoin ran from about $1,000 to nearly **$20,000**, while hundreds of startups raised billions through **ICOs** on Ethereum. It was the industry's first global fundraising frenzy, equal parts innovation and mania.

ICOs made fundraising simple: publish a whitepaper, sell tokens to the public, and list on exchanges immediately. In 2017 alone, projects raised over **$6.5 billion** across more than **900** token sales. Major names like Filecoin, Tezos, EOS, Brave, Chainlink, and Cardano emerged during this wave. Retail investors poured in, hoping early tokens would deliver venture-scale returns.

The boom had real technical and cultural impact. It proved that open networks could fund themselves without traditional venture capital. It created community-owned protocols, popularized token incentives, and laid foundations that later powered DeFi and NFTs. But it also attracted scams, vaporware, and careless teams. Many projects raised millions with little more than marketing and a Telegram group.

When Bitcoin peaked in mid-December, the bubble burst. By late 2018, BTC had fallen more than 80%, and most ICO tokens were down 90% or more. Regulators stepped in, with the SEC classifying many ICOs as unregistered securities. The bust cleaned out bad actors and forced the industry to mature.

The 2017 ICO boom remains a defining moment: a chaotic sprint that proved both the power and the risks of open, permissionless fundraising. It created real infrastructure and lasting projects, but it also taught a harsh lesson about speculation outpacing substance.
