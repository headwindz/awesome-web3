On September 4, 2017, China banned **ICOs** and ordered domestic crypto exchanges to shut down. Bitcoin dropped sharply, China's dominance in trading ended overnight, and global volume migrated to offshore venues.

The ban arrived during peak ICO mania. In July and August alone, hundreds of Chinese ICOs raised billions with little oversight, and retail investors were losing money in obvious scams. The People's Bank of China declared ICOs illegal fundraising and required refunds. Within weeks, major exchanges like BTC China, Huobi, and OKCoin were ordered to close.

Markets panicked. Bitcoin fell from around $4,900 to near $3,000 in days, and altcoins dropped even harder. But the shock also proved crypto's resilience. Trading quickly moved to Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and the U.S. Tether (USDT) became a dominant trading pair, and offshore exchanges such as Binance absorbed much of the displaced volume.

The ban marked the end of China's trading leadership. Mining stayed for a few more years, but trading and startup activity shifted abroad. In the long run, the crackdown forced the industry to diversify and mature, pushing projects to friendlier jurisdictions and accelerating a global, rather than China-centric, crypto market.
