On June 17, 2016, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in **The DAO** smart contract, draining 3.6 million ETH (~$50 million at the time) in what becomes the most consequential event in Ethereum's history.

## What Was The DAO?

The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was an ambitious experiment in decentralized venture capital. Between April and May 2016, it raised **150 million USD** worth of ETH from over 11,000 contributors, making it the largest crowdfunding campaign in history at that time.

The concept: token holders could vote on investment proposals, and smart contracts would automatically execute the community's decisions without traditional management structure.

## The Exploit

The attacker discovered a **recursive call vulnerability** (later known as a "reentrancy attack") in The DAO's withdrawal function. By repeatedly calling the withdrawal function before the balance was updated, they could drain funds far exceeding their entitlement.

**Timeline:**

- **June 17**: Attack begins, draining ~30% of The DAO's funds
- **June 17-20**: Community debates response options
- **June 24**: Soft fork proposal to freeze funds fails due to DoS vulnerability
- **July 15**: White Hat group secures remaining funds
- **July 20**: Hard fork executes, returning funds to original contributors

## The Great Debate

The Ethereum community faced an existential question: Should the blockchain be rolled back to reverse the theft, or should the principle of **"code is law"** be upheld regardless of consequences?

**Arguments for fork:**

- Save innocent investors from catastrophic losses
- The exploit violated the intent of The DAO's code
- Ethereum was young enough to establish that malicious exploits won't be tolerated

**Arguments against fork:**

- Violates blockchain immutability principle
- Sets dangerous precedent for future interventions
- "Code is law" - if smart contracts are law, bugs are features

## The Split

The hard fork proceeded with ~85-90% community support, creating two chains:

- **Ethereum (ETH)** - Continues with the fork, funds returned to DAO token holders
- **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** - Maintains original chain where the hack remains part of history

This philosophical split highlighted a fundamental tension in blockchain governance: the clash between immutability as a technical property versus the community's ability to coordinate around shared values.
