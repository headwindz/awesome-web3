On July 9, 2016, Bitcoin hit its second halving, cutting the block reward from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC at block #420,000. Daily new supply fell from 3,600 to 1,800 BTC, cutting miner revenue in half overnight. The immediate market reaction was muted—price stayed around $650. But the supply reduction set the stage for the 2017 surge to $20,000.

The impact was delayed but inevitable. Six months later Bitcoin was $900, one year later $2,500, and by December 2017 it reached nearly $20,000. This validated the core thesis: fixed supply + programmed scarcity = powerful economic incentive over time.

## The Four-Year Cycle

Halving events showed a consistent pattern:

- The 2012 halving preceded 2013's $1,100 rally
- The 2016 halving preceded 2017's mania to $20K
- The 2020 halving preceded 2021's $69K peak

Each cycle follows the pattern: halving → accumulation → bull market acceleration → peak mania → crash → recovery.

## For Miners

The halving was a network stress test. Revenue cut 50% forced inefficient operations to shut down, while larger farms expanded. Hash rate briefly dipped then resumed climbing. The network got stronger, not weaker—and mining became increasingly professionalized.

## Key Lessons

1. **Supply reduction matters**: Even when predictable, 50% reduction drives long-term cycles
2. **Timing matters**: Effects take 6-18 months to fully play out
3. **Markets aren't perfectly efficient**: Despite everyone knowing halvings occur, markets are repeatedly "surprised"
4. **Programmability works**: Bitcoin's fixed supply creates real economic pressure

**The verdict:** The 2016 halving proved that Bitcoin's programmed scarcity isn't theoretical—it's practical economics. Predictable events can still drive massive bull markets when supply is actually constrained.
