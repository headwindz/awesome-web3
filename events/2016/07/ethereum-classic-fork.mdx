On July 20, 2016, Ethereum hard forked to reverse The DAO hack. The majority followed the new chain (ETH), while a minority maintained the original history as Ethereum Classic (ETC). The split defined the immutability vs intervention debate.

ETH became the dominant smart contract platform through pragmatic governance decisions. ETC survived as a principled alternative committed to absolute immutability, but faced recurring security challenges due to lower hash power.

Why it mattered:

- Proved blockchains are social systems, not just code
- Created precedent for handling catastrophic events
- Split one community into two with distinct philosophies

## The Trade-off

**ETH's Pragmatic Approach:**

- Reversed theft to restore user funds
- Set precedent for intervention when needed
- Questions about centralization and future forks
- But enabled rapid DeFi development

**ETC's Immutability Stance:**

- Honored "Code is law" principle
- Maintained original history, no reversions
- Suffered 51% attacks from smaller hash power
- Less secure, less adoption

## Long-term Outcome

By 2024, the market had rendered its verdict clearly:

- **ETH**: 100x+ larger market cap, leading smart contract platform
- **ETC**: Surviving niche PoW alternative with smaller community

Both coexist peacefully. ETH's pragmatism won in adoption and development. ETC's principles attracted ideological supporters.

**The lesson:** There's no perfect answer in decentralized governance—just trade-offs. Communities choose different values and both can survive, but markets favor pragmatism over absolutism.
