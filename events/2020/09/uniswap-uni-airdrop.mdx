On September 16, 2020, **Uniswap** launched the **UNI** governance token and airdropped **400 UNI** to every wallet that had ever used the protocol. The surprise distribution set the gold standard for retroactive rewards.

The airdrop was a direct response to SushiSwap's vampire attack. By giving ownership to actual users, Uniswap aligned incentives overnight and pulled liquidity back. At launch, 400 UNI was worth roughly $1,200, and it later climbed much higher during the bull market. Liquidity providers received additional allocations, making some early users overnight millionaires.

The move reshaped crypto culture. It proved that real product usage could be rewarded, not just speculative capital. It sparked a wave of copycat airdrops and created the "airdrop hunting" behavior that now defines many new protocol launches.

More importantly, UNI turned Uniswap into a community‑governed protocol, giving users a say in fees, treasury spending, and long‑term direction. The airdrop wasn't just a giveaway; it was a strategic decentralization play that changed how crypto projects think about ownership.
