On August 11, 2020, **MicroStrategy** announced it bought **21,454 BTC** for $250 million, making Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. CEO **Michael Saylor** became a vocal evangelist and sparked a wave of corporate balance‑sheet adoption.

The thesis was straightforward: cash was a "melting ice cube" in a world of aggressive monetary expansion. Bitcoin, with a fixed supply and global liquidity, looked like a superior store of value. MicroStrategy continued buying, financing purchases with equity and convertible debt, and eventually became the largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

The move shifted crypto's narrative. Bitcoin was no longer just a retail phenomenon; it was a corporate treasury strategy. Other firms followed, including Square (Block) and later Tesla. MicroStrategy's stock began trading as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin itself, amplifying both upside and downside.

Whether one agrees with the strategy or not, the announcement changed the market. It legitimized Bitcoin in boardrooms and made institutional adoption feel inevitable rather than hypothetical.
