On August 28, 2020, an anonymous developer known as **Chef Nomi** launched **SushiSwap**, executing crypto's most audacious "**vampire attack**"—a hostile takeover that attempted to drain billions in liquidity from Uniswap by offering SUSHI token incentives to liquidity providers.

## The Setup: Uniswap's Vulnerability

**Uniswap's Situation in August 2020:**

- **Dominant DEX**: $500M+ in liquidity
- **No native token**: Just protocol fees (0.3%)
- **No loyalty mechanism**: LPs could leave anytime
- **Open source code**: Easily forkable
- **DeFi Summer peak**: Everyone seeking yield

**The Opportunity:**

Uniswap's liquidity providers were:

- Earning 0.3% trading fees only
- Not receiving any governance token
- Ripe for a better offer

## The Attack Vector

**How SushiSwap Worked:**

1. **Forked Uniswap's code** (open source)
2. **Added SUSHI token rewards** for liquidity providers
3. **Let users stake Uniswap LP tokens** on SushiSwap
4. **Promised migration**: After 2 weeks, migrate all liquidity to SushiSwap
5. **Developer rewards**: 10% of all SUSHI to developers

**The Incentive Structure:**

- Stake your **UNI-V2 LP tokens** on SushiSwap
- Earn **SUSHI tokens** (while still earning Uniswap fees)
- After 2 weeks: **Migration event** moves liquidity to SushiSwap
- Result: Same AMM, but now you have SUSHI tokens too

## The Migration Event

**September 9, 2020 - "The Great Migration":**

At block 10,850,000:

- **$1+ billion** in Uniswap liquidity staked on SushiSwap
- Migration function called
- Liquidity pulled from Uniswap → moved to SushiSwap
- Uniswap TVL crashed ~70% overnight

**The Drama:**

This was **DeFi's first hostile takeover**—and it was working.

## Chef Nomi's Exit Scam (Almost)

**September 5, 2020 - 4 Days Before Migration:**

Chef Nomi, the anonymous founder:

- **Sold 2.5M SUSHI tokens** (~$13M)
- **Dumped on community** who trusted him
- **Twitter exploded** with rage
- **SUSHI price crashed** 50%+

**His Justification:**

> "I did nothing wrong. The SUSHI tokens were allocated to developers. I am just cashing out what I deserve." - Chef Nomi

**The Community Response:**

- Outrage and accusations of rug pull
- Calls to fork SushiSwap again
- Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and others stepped in
- Migration still happened (community commitment)

## The Redemption Arc

**September 11, 2020:**

Chef Nomi **returned all the funds**:

> "I fucked up. And I am sorry. I will return all the ETH back to the treasury." - Chef Nomi

**The Transfer:**

- Returned ~$14M to SushiSwap treasury
- Handed control to **Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX CEO)**
- Community governance activated
- Migration deemed successful

**SBF Takes Control:**

Sam Bankman-Fried became the interim leader and:

- Stabilized the protocol
- Implemented multi-sig
- Set up proper governance
- Eventually handed control to community (0xMaki and others)

## The Aftermath

**What Happened to Each Protocol:**

**Uniswap:**

- Lost $1B+ liquidity overnight
- **September 16, 2020**: Airdropped UNI token (response to SushiSwap)
- Recovered all liquidity within weeks
- Remained dominant DEX
- Launched V3 with innovations

**SushiSwap:**

- Successfully migrated liquidity
- Built sustainable community
- Expanded to multi-chain
- Added lending (Kashi), launchpad (MISO)
- Became top 5 DEX
- Still exists today (2026)

**Chef Nomi:**

- Disappeared after returning funds
- Never revealed identity
- Became cautionary tale
- Meme legend status

## The Innovation: Vampire Attacks

**What SushiSwap Invented:**

The **vampire attack** became a known DeFi strategy:

1. **Fork existing protocol**
2. **Add token incentives**
3. **Drain competitor's liquidity**
4. **Build on their work**

**Who Copied It:**

- **SpiritSwap** vampired SpookySwap (Fantom)
- **Tomb Finance** vampired other algorithmic stablecoins
- **UniSwap forks** across all chains
- Countless others tried and failed

## The Strategic Lessons

**What SushiSwap Proved:**

✅ **Open source = vulnerable** to forks
✅ **Liquidity is mercenary** without incentives
✅ **Token rewards work** for bootstrapping
✅ **Community can forgive** (if you return funds)
✅ **First-mover advantage** isn't permanent

**What It Disproved:**

❌ **Forking guarantees success** (most forks died)
❌ **Anonymous founders are safe** (Chef Nomi nearly destroyed it)
❌ **Vampire attacks always work** (many failed)

## The Uniswap Response: UNI Token

**September 16, 2020 - One Week After SushiSwap Migration:**

Uniswap announced:

- **UNI governance token**
- **400 UNI airdrop** to every historical user
- **Worth $1,200+** at launch
- One of the largest airdrops ever

**The Irony:**

SushiSwap's vampire attack **forced Uniswap to launch a token**, which:

- Made early users wealthy
- Strengthened Uniswap's position
- Created governance alignment
- Became more valuable than SUSHI

**SushiSwap accidentally made Uniswap stronger.**

## The Numbers

**At Peak (September 2020):**

- **SushiSwap TVL**: $1.5 billion
- **SUSHI market cap**: $500M+
- **Uniswap TVL**: Recovered to $2B+ after UNI launch
- **Chef Nomi's returned funds**: $14M

**Long-term (2026):**

- **Uniswap**: Still #1 DEX
- **SushiSwap**: Still operational, top 10 DEX
- **SUSHI price**: Down 95%+ from peak
- **UNI price**: Outperformed SUSHI massively

## Why It Matters

**SushiSwap's vampire attack was pivotal** because:

1. **Proved DeFi composability** could be weaponized
2. **Forced incumbents to innovate** (Uniswap → UNI token)
3. **Created vampire attack playbook** (copied hundreds of times)
4. **Showed anonymous founders risks** (Chef Nomi drama)
5. **Demonstrated community resilience** (survived exit scam attempt)

**The Cultural Impact:**

- "Vampire attack" entered crypto lexicon
- Chef Nomi became infamous meme
- Sam Bankman-Fried gained trust (ironically, before FTX collapse)
- Open source projects learned to defend liquidity
- Token launches became mandatory for competitive DEXs

## The Quotes

**Chef Nomi's Infamous Tweet:**

> "I did nothing wrong. I am cashing out."

_Followed days later by:_

> "I fucked up. And I am sorry."

**SBF's Take (2020):**

> "SushiSwap has real potential. The community deserves better than an anonymous founder dumping on them. I'll help stabilize this."

_Narrator: He would later do worse with FTX._

**Uniswap Founder Hayden Adams:**

> "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but vampire attacks are a new level."

## The Legacy

**What SushiSwap Changed Forever:**

- **DEX wars** became about token incentives, not just tech
- **Liquidity mining** became mandatory for new DEXs
- **Vampire attacks** became standard competitive strategy
- **Fork → improve** became viable path
- **Community ownership** proved more important than code

**The Irony:**

SushiSwap tried to kill Uniswap, but:

- Both still exist in 2026
- Uniswap is stronger than ever
- SushiSwap proved sustainable
- The "vampire" became just another DEX
- Competition made both protocols better

**The Ultimate Lesson:**

You can fork the code, but you can't fork the community, the liquidity, the trust, and the network effects—unless you offer something genuinely better (or at least more lucrative tokens).

SushiSwap offered tokens. It worked. But Uniswap responded with better tokens, and network effects proved durable.

**The vampire attack succeeded tactically but failed strategically.** Both protocols survived, and the DeFi ecosystem got stronger from the competition.

And Chef Nomi? He got a meme legacy, a redemption arc, and permanent anonymity.

Sometimes that's enough. 🍣
