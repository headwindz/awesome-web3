On May 11, 2020, Bitcoin's **third halving** cut block rewards from **12.5 to 6.25 BTC** at block **#630,000**. The supply shock came during pandemic chaos and set the runway for the first institution-led bull market, culminating near $69,000 in 2021.

The immediate market reaction was muted. Bitcoin hovered around $8,600 and moved sideways for weeks. But the halving reduced daily new supply from 1,800 BTC to 900 BTC, quietly tightening the market. As macro stimulus flooded the world with liquidity, Bitcoin's fixed supply narrative gained traction.

The difference this cycle was institutional participation. MicroStrategy began buying in August 2020, Square followed in October, and other firms and funds joined as custody and compliance infrastructure matured. By late 2020, PayPal opened crypto access to hundreds of millions of users, and the bull run accelerated into 2021.

The 2020 halving reinforced the four-year cycle pattern but showed a new driver: corporate treasuries and institutional capital. It marked the point where Bitcoin's scarcity story met a macro environment primed for hard assets, and the result was the largest adoption wave the network had ever seen.
