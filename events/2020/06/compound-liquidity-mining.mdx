On June 15, 2020, **Compound Finance** launched **COMP token distribution** through liquidity mining, inadvertently creating the "**yield farming**" phenomenon that would define DeFi Summer and transform decentralized finance forever.

## What Happened

**The Mechanism:**

Compound, a lending/borrowing protocol, began distributing its governance token **COMP** to users based on:

- Amount of assets supplied
- Amount borrowed
- Proportional share of activity

**The Formula:**

- 0.5 COMP per Ethereum block
- Distributed to lenders and borrowers
- ~2,880 COMP per day
- No VC pre-mine restrictions

## The Unintended Consequences

**Why It Went Viral:**

1. **Borrow to Earn**: You could borrow and EARN tokens

   - Negative interest rates became possible
   - Recursive strategies emerged
   - "Money Lego" composability exploded

2. **APY Mania**:

   - Headlines of "2000% APY!"
   - Yield farming tutorials everywhere
   - Twitter filled with DeFi degen farmers

3. **COMP Price Pump**:
   - Launched at ~$60
   - Hit $372 within days (June 2020)
   - Made Compound briefly more valuable than Coinbase

## The Yield Farming Playbook

**What People Did:**

```
1. Deposit stablecoins (USDC/DAI) into Compound
2. Borrow against them (often the same asset)
3. Re-deposit borrowed assets
4. Repeat (leverage up)
5. Earn COMP tokens worth more than interest paid
6. Sell COMP for profit
```

**Advanced Strategies:**

- Use Yearn to automate
- Leverage through InstaDapp
- Arbitrage COMP rewards across pools
- Farm → dump → rotate to next protocol

## The Domino Effect

**Competitors Copied the Model:**

Within weeks, every DeFi protocol launched token farming:

**June-August 2020:**

- **Balancer** (BAL) - June 1
- **Compound** (COMP) - June 15 ← The big bang
- **Aave** announced rewards
- **Curve** (CRV) - August 13
- **SushiSwap** (SUSHI) - August 27
- **Yearn** (YFI) - July 17
- **Uniswap** (UNI) - September 17

## The Numbers

**DeFi Growth (May → September 2020):**

- **Total Value Locked**:

  - May: $1 billion
  - June: $1.5 billion
  - September: $9 billion
  - 800% growth in 4 months

- **Compound TVL**:

  - Pre-COMP: $100M
  - Post-COMP: $2B+
  - 20x growth

- **Active Addresses**:
  - DeFi went from niche to mainstream
  - MetaMask users exploded
  - Ethereum gas fees skyrocketed

## The Problems

**Issues That Emerged:**

1. **Mercenary Capital**

   - Farmers dumped tokens immediately
   - No long-term alignment
   - Protocols became Ponzis

2. **Vampire Attacks**

   - SushiSwap drained Uniswap
   - Aggressive forking
   - "Exit scams" proliferated

3. **Gas Fees**

   - Ethereum became unusable
   - Small users priced out
   - $100+ transaction fees

4. **Complexity & Risk**
   - Smart contract bugs
   - Liquidation cascades
   - Impermanent loss
   - Many got rekt

## Why It Matters

**Compound's COMP launch was the most important moment in DeFi history** because:

1. **Proved Product-Market Fit**: People want to earn on crypto assets
2. **Created "Yield Farming"**: A new behavior and culture
3. **Governance Token Playbook**: Every project copied this model
4. **Kickstarted DeFi Summer**: The sector exploded from here
5. **Ethereum Fee Market**: Showed demand existed at scale

**The Critique:**

Critics argued that liquidity mining was:

- **Unsustainable**: Selling equity to buy growth
- **Not real usage**: Mercenaries, not users
- **Token dilution**: Infinite sell pressure
- **Regulatory risk**: "Unregistered securities"

**The Defense:**

Supporters said it:

- **Bootstrapped liquidity**: Cold start problem solved
- **Distributed ownership**: Decentralization achieved
- **Aligned incentives**: Users became stakeholders
- **Community building**: True believers filtered from mercs

## The Legacy

**What Changed Forever:**

- Every new DeFi project now needs token incentives
- "TVL" became the key metric
- Yield optimization became an industry (Yearn, Convex, etc.)
- "DeFi degen" culture was born
- Ethereum proved it could handle massive financial activity

**Robert Leshner's Take** (Compound founder):

> "We wanted to distribute governance tokens to users. We didn't anticipate the magnitude of the response."

That's an understatement. Compound's liquidity mining launch didn't just distribute tokens—it launched an entire economy, created a new financial paradigm, and proved that DeFi could go from "nerd experiment" to "mainstream finance" in a matter of weeks.

**DeFi Summer** had begun, and nothing would be the same again.
