On June 15, 2020, **Compound Finance** began distributing **COMP** to users based on their lending and borrowing activity. The move accidentally ignited the "yield farming" craze that defined DeFi Summer.

The mechanism was simple: suppliers and borrowers earned COMP every block, which meant users could borrow and still come out ahead if COMP prices rose. That created a wave of leverage loops, automated strategies, and headline yields that pulled capital into DeFi at record speed. In days, COMP surged from around $60 to over $300, and Compound's total value locked jumped from roughly $100 million to billions.

Other protocols quickly copied the playbook. Token incentives became the standard way to bootstrap liquidity, and governance tokens became a core part of DeFi culture. The result was a rapid expansion of on-chain lending, trading, and yield optimization.

Liquidity mining also exposed real risks: mercenary capital, short-term incentives, smart contract vulnerabilities, and soaring gas fees. But the core insight stuck. By tying ownership to usage, Compound showed how decentralized protocols could grow fast without traditional marketing or venture distribution. The COMP launch was the moment DeFi went from niche experiment to a full-blown financial ecosystem.
