The summer of 2020 marks the explosive emergence of **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, transforming Ethereum into a parallel financial system offering lending, borrowing, trading, and derivatives—all without traditional intermediaries.

## The Catalyst: Liquidity Mining

On June 15, 2020, **Compound Finance** launches COMP token distribution to users, pioneering "liquidity mining" or "yield farming." This innovation creates a flywheel effect:

1. Users supply assets to earn COMP tokens
2. COMP token value rises with platform usage
3. Higher returns attract more capital
4. Additional capital increases platform utility
5. Cycle repeats

## Explosive Growth

**Total Value Locked (TVL) trajectory:**

- June 2020: $1 billion
- September 2020: $9 billion
- November 2020: $15 billion
- Growth: **1,400% in six months**

## Key Protocols That Defined DeFi Summer

**Compound** - Algorithmic money markets for lending/borrowing

- Pioneered liquidity mining
- Governance entirely by COMP token holders

**Uniswap** - Automated Market Maker (AMM)

- Constant product formula (x \* y = k)
- Anyone can provide liquidity and earn fees
- No order books, no centralized matching

**Aave** - Decentralized lending with flash loans

- Flash loans: borrow millions without collateral if repaid in same transaction
- Enabled arbitrage and liquidation strategies previously impossible

**Yearn Finance** - Yield optimization aggregator

- Created by Andre Cronje in ~2 weeks
- Automatically moves capital to highest yields
- YFI token became worth more than BTC at peak

**Curve** - Stablecoin DEX with minimal slippage

- Optimized for stablecoin swaps
- Became DeFi's liquidity backbone

**SushiSwap** - Vampire attack on Uniswap

- Forked Uniswap's code
- Incentivized migration with SUSHI rewards
- Introduced "vampire attacks" as DeFi phenomenon

## Innovation Concepts Introduced

- **Composability**: DeFi protocols as "money legos" that plug together
- **Liquidity mining**: Distributing governance tokens to users
- **Flash loans**: Uncollateralized loans within a single transaction
- **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**: Order book-free trading
- **Yield optimization**: Automated strategies for maximum returns
- **Governance tokens**: Community-owned protocols

## The Legacy

DeFi Summer proved that blockchain could recreate sophisticated financial primitives without banks, brokers, or clearinghouses. It demonstrated that **code could replace trust**, that **anyone could access financial services**, and that **communities could govern complex protocols**.

The summer also revealed challenges: high gas fees, smart contract risks, impermanent loss, and the difficulty of making DeFi accessible to non-technical users. These lessons shaped the next evolution toward Layer 2 solutions and improved user experiences.
