On October 21, 2020, **PayPal** announced that its **300+ million users** could buy, sell, and hold major cryptocurrencies inside the app. Bitcoin rallied on the news, and mainstream adoption suddenly felt real.

The feature let users purchase BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH directly in PayPal without using a crypto exchange. Custody was handled by Paxos. The launch was limited to the U.S. at first and, critically, users could not withdraw coins to external wallets. Purists criticized the custodial model, but for mainstream users it removed the biggest barrier: fear of unfamiliar platforms.

PayPal's move was a legitimacy signal. A global payments giant embracing crypto forced regulators, banks, and competitors to take the market seriously. It also arrived at a perfect moment: post‑halving supply tightness, growing institutional interest, and a macro environment defined by stimulus and inflation fears.

In the years that followed, PayPal expanded crypto features, added Venmo integration, and eventually enabled withdrawals. Regardless of the limitations, the 2020 announcement marked a turning point: crypto had entered the mainstream financial UI.
