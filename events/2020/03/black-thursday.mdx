On March 12, 2020, crypto markets crashed more than 50% in a single day as COVID-19 panic hit global finance. The shock triggered a chain of DeFi liquidations that nearly broke MakerDAO and exposed how fragile on-chain systems could be under stress.

Bitcoin fell from about $7,900 to $3,850, and Ethereum dropped from roughly $195 to $86. The selloff was not just a crypto story. Stocks were halting, oil collapsed, and everyone was selling everything for cash. In DeFi, that meant collateral values imploded while smart contracts tried to liquidate positions in real time.

MakerDAO took the hardest hit. Its system relies on ETH collateral and automated liquidation auctions. Network congestion sent gas fees soaring, liquidators could not reliably bid, and a bot won some auctions with $0 bids. The result was bad debt and a near insolvency event. Maker governance had to mint and sell new MKR to recapitalize the system.

Black Thursday became a stress test for all of DeFi. It revealed vulnerabilities in oracles, auction design, and dependency on Ethereum block space when demand spikes. The crisis forced protocols to harden their liquidation mechanisms, diversify collateral, and plan for extreme volatility. It also proved that DeFi could survive a global liquidity shock, albeit with bruises and an urgent need to mature.
