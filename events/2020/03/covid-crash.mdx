On March 12-13, 2020, Bitcoin plunged from around $8,000 to **$3,800** in 24 hours as COVID-19 panic tore through global markets. Ethereum fell to about $90, and crypto briefly traded like the riskiest asset on the planet. The crash shattered the "digital gold" narrative in the short term, but it also marked the starting line for crypto's biggest bull run.

The selloff was driven by a global dash for cash. Stocks hit circuit breakers, oil collapsed, and leveraged positions were forced to liquidate. Bitcoin, highly liquid and traded 24/7, became a source of immediate liquidity. Derivatives platforms like BitMEX amplified the move with cascading liquidations.

Then the macro backdrop flipped. Central banks cut rates to zero and launched massive stimulus. The money printer meme went mainstream. Bitcoin recovered quickly, broke $10,000 by summer, and entered a new narrative as an inflation hedge in a world of unlimited monetary expansion.

By late 2020 and through 2021, that recovery turned into a full bull cycle driven by halving scarcity, institutional adoption, and broader mainstream access. The crash was brutal, but it reset the market and set the stage for the next wave.
