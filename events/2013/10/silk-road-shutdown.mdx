On October 2, 2013, the FBI shuts down **Silk Road**, the notorious darknet marketplace that facilitated over $1.2 billion in illegal transactions using Bitcoin, and arrests its creator Ross Ulbricht ("Dread Pirate Roberts") in a San Francisco library.

## The Seizure

- **Bitcoin seized**: ~174,000 BTC (worth ~$144 million at the time)
- **Platform lifespan**: February 2011 - October 2013
- **Transactions**: Over 1.2 million conducted
- **Vendors**: ~4,000 active sellers

The FBI's takedown initially caused Bitcoin's price to drop ~20%, from $145 to $109. However, Bitcoin proved its resilience—the network continued operating without interruption, demonstrating that Bitcoin itself was neutral infrastructure independent of any single use case.

## Regulatory Watershed

This event fundamentally shifted government perception of cryptocurrencies. Rather than treating Bitcoin as a fringe experiment, regulators worldwide began developing frameworks for:

- Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance
- Know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for exchanges
- Tax reporting obligations
- Legal classification of digital assets

Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, a controversial decision that sparked ongoing debates about proportionality in sentencing for non-violent crimes and the nature of running a marketplace versus conducting illegal acts oneself.
