On December 5, 2013, the PBOC barred banks from providing Bitcoin services. Prices fell sharply and the market absorbed its first major regulatory shock.

The ban did not end Bitcoin activity inside China, but it established a recurring pattern: China restrictions trigger panic, prices drop, and the network adapts.

Why it mattered:

- It proved regulation could move markets quickly.
- It started the recurring "China bans Bitcoin" cycle.
- It showed Bitcoin could survive hostile policy actions.
