Mt. Gox had once felt like Bitcoin's beating heart, processing most global trades. On February 24, 2014, it filed for bankruptcy after losing about 850,000 BTC (roughly $450 million at the time). The exchange blamed a long-running hack tied to transaction malleability, and the collapse sent shockwaves through the young crypto world.

The fallout became a turning point: it proved that Bitcoin could survive even if its biggest exchange did not, and it pushed the industry toward better security, professional custody, and the first serious wave of decentralized exchange ideas.
