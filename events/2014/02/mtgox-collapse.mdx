Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange handling 70% of all Bitcoin transactions, files for bankruptcy after losing approximately 850,000 BTC (worth $450 million at the time). The exchange claimed the bitcoins were stolen due to a hack exploiting transaction malleability.

This catastrophic event highlighted the risks of centralized exchanges and led to increased focus on security, custody solutions, and the development of decentralized exchanges.
