On March 13, 2024, Ethereum activates the **Dencun upgrade** (combining Deneb + Cancun), introducing **EIP-4844** (proto-danksharding) and delivering the most significant scaling improvement in Ethereum's history. Layer 2 transaction costs drop by **90-95%** literally overnight.

## What is Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844)?

Previously, Layer 2 rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync) posted transaction data to Ethereum mainnet as expensive `CALLDATA`, competing with regular transactions for block space.

**EIP-4844 introduces "blobs":**

- **Blobs**: Temporary data storage (~125 KB each, 3-6 per block)
- **Data availability**: Stored for ~18 days, then pruned
- **Cost**: 10-100x cheaper than CALLDATA
- **Security**: Same cryptographic guarantees
- **Purpose-built**: Specifically for rollup data posting

## The Impact: Before vs After

**Transaction Costs on Layer 2s:**

| Network  | Before Dencun | After Dencun | Reduction |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Arbitrum | $0.50-2.00    | $0.01-0.05   | ~95%      |
| Optimism | $0.40-1.50    | $0.01-0.04   | ~95%      |
| Base     | $0.60-2.00    | $0.01-0.05   | ~96%      |
| zkSync   | $0.30-1.00    | $0.01-0.03   | ~95%      |
| Starknet | $0.50-1.50    | $0.02-0.05   | ~94%      |

**Average swap on Uniswap:**

- Mainnet: $5-50 (depending on congestion)
- L2 before Dencun: $0.50-2
- **L2 after Dencun: $0.01-0.05**

## Technical Components

Dencun combines two upgrade tracks:

**Consensus Layer (Deneb):**

- Blob-carrying beacon blocks
- Blob verification by validators
- Blob gossip across network

**Execution Layer (Cancun):**

- EIP-4844: Proto-danksharding (blobs!)
- EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes
- EIP-4788: Beacon block root in EVM
- EIP-5656: MCOPY opcode
- EIP-6780: Self-destruct changes
- EIP-7044: Perpetually valid signed exits
- EIP-7045: Longer attestation inclusion

## Adoption and Usage

**Immediate Uptake:**

- Base, Optimism, Arbitrum switched to blobs within hours
- zkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM followed
- Blob usage: 3-6 blobs per block consistently
- **Blob gas market**: Separate fee market from regular gas

**Cost Comparison (March 2024):**

- Posting 128 KB CALLDATA: $30,000+
- Posting 128 KB blob: $10-50
- **Savings: 99%+**

## Real-World Effects

**User Experience:**

- DeFi becomes economically viable on Layer 2
- NFT minting costs drop to pennies
- Gaming transactions become affordable
- Social apps (Farcaster, Lens) scale sustainably
- Onchain order books feasible

**Network Effects:**

- Layer 2 TVL increases significantly
- Base surges to #2 L2 by activity
- Mainnet sees less congestion (activity moves to L2s)
- Average mainnet gas price drops

**Developer Incentives:**

- Building on L2 becomes default choice
- Complex dApps can afford frequent state updates
- New use cases emerge (onchain gaming, social)

## The Path Forward

Dencun is **proto**-danksharding because it's step 1 of a multi-phase plan:

**Current (Post-Dencun):**

- 3-6 blobs per block
- ~375-750 KB blob space per block
- ~45-90 MB per day

**Future (Full Danksharding):**

- Target: 16 MB per block
- ~1-2 GB per day
- Would support 100,000+ TPS across all L2s
- Requires: Data Availability Sampling (DAS)

**Other Scaling Efforts:**

- Verkle trees (reduce state bloat)
- Statelessness (reduce node requirements)
- Account abstraction (better UX)
- PBS (proposer-builder separation already live)

## Why It Matters

Before Dencun, Ethereum's scaling strategy relied on Layer 2s, but L2s were still relatively expensive due to CALLDATA costs. Dencun made the L2-centric roadmap economically viable.

**The Vision Realized:**

- Ethereum Layer 1: Settlement and security
- Layer 2s: Execution and scale
- Users: Cheap transactions with Ethereum security

Dencun proves Ethereum can evolve and scale without compromising decentralization or security—fulfilling the "modular blockchain" thesis where different layers specialize in different functions.
