On March 13, 2024, Ethereum shipped the Dencun upgrade and activated EIP 4844, introducing blob data for rollups. The change cut layer 2 data costs by roughly 90 to 95 percent overnight.

Rollups no longer had to post expensive calldata for every batch, which made L2 transactions dramatically cheaper and more predictable. The result was an immediate wave of lower fees across major networks and a stronger case for Ethereum's modular roadmap.

Why it mattered:

- It made rollup economics viable at scale.
- It accelerated the shift of activity from mainnet to L2s.
- It proved Ethereum could deliver major upgrades without downtime.
