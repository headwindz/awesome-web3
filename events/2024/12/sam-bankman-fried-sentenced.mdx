On March 28, 2024, **Sam Bankman-Fried** (SBF) is sentenced to **25 years in federal prison** for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history through FTX and Alameda Research. The sentence closes a dramatic chapter that began with FTX's November 2022 collapse.

## The Trial & Verdict

**November 2, 2023**: Jury convicts SBF on all 7 counts

- Wire fraud on customers
- Wire fraud on lenders
- Conspiracy to commit wire fraud (x3)
- Conspiracy to commit money laundering
- Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud

**Key Evidence:**

- Caroline Ellison's testimony (ex-girlfriend, Alameda CEO)
- Gary Wang's testimony (FTX co-founder)
- Nishad Singh's testimony (FTX engineering director)
- Billions in customer funds misused
- Code backdoors allowing Alameda special privileges
- False statements to investors and customers

## The Sentencing

**March 28, 2024**: Judge Lewis Kaplan delivers sentence

**Prosecution Requested:** 40-50 years
**Defense Requested:** 5-6 years
**Actual Sentence:** **25 years + forfeiture of $11 billion**

**Judge Kaplan's Reasoning:**

"Mr. Bankman-Fried knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught, but he's not going to admit a thing."

The judge cited:

- Perjury on the stand
- Lack of genuine remorse
- Obstruction of justice
- Risk of recidivism
- Extraordinary harm to victims

## What Happened to FTX

**Customer Losses:**

- $8+ billion in customer funds missing
- 1 million+ creditors affected
- Recovery: Ongoing bankruptcy proceedings

**Co-conspirators:**

- **Caroline Ellison**: Sentenced to 2 years (cooperation)
- **Gary Wang**: Awaiting sentencing (cooperation)
- **Nishad Singh**: Awaiting sentencing (cooperation)
- **Ryan Salame**: Sentenced to 7.5 years (no cooperation)

## The Fallen Empire

**At FTX's Peak (November 2021):**

- $32 billion valuation
- Sponsorships: Miami Heat Arena, Tom Brady, Steph Curry
- Super Bowl ad
- Political donations: $70M+ to politicians
- Effective Altruism: Billions pledged

**After Collapse:**

- Bankruptcy
- Criminal charges
- Chapter 11 proceedings
- Assets seized worldwide

## Industry Impact

**Regulatory Response:**

- Increased scrutiny of centralized exchanges
- DOJ creates National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team
- SEC doubles down on enforcement

**Market Behavior:**

- Flight to regulated exchanges
- Emphasis on proof-of-reserves
- "Not your keys, not your crypto" resurgence
- Institutional custody solutions boom

**Cultural Shift:**

- End of "effective altruism" crypto philanthropy era
- Skepticism of celebrity-backed projects
- Demand for transparency and audits

## The Lessons

1. **Separation of concerns**: Trading firm and exchange must be separate
2. **Custody matters**: Customer assets must be segregated
3. **Audit everything**: "Trust me bro" doesn't work at scale
4. **Regulation has purpose**: Protection from fraud benefits everyone
5. **Character counts**: Genius and good intentions don't excuse theft

SBF's sentence sends a clear message: crypto may be innovative, but financial crime is still financial crime. The 25-year sentence—effectively a life sentence for his career—serves as a deterrent while acknowledging his relatively young age compared to traditional white-collar criminals.

He's currently appealing the conviction, but legal experts give him slim chances of success. FTX's customers may recover 50-90% of funds through bankruptcy proceedings, partially due to the crypto market's recovery since the collapse.
