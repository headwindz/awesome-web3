The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves spot Ethereum ETFs from multiple issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. This unexpected approval comes months after the Bitcoin ETF launch and represents institutional legitimization of Ethereum as an investment asset.

The approval signals regulatory acceptance of proof-of-stake networks and smart contract platforms. Within the first weeks of trading, Ethereum ETFs attract billions in inflows, though at a slower pace than Bitcoin ETFs initially.
