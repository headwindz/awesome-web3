On May 23, 2024, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETF filings from major issuers, a surprise move that extended institutional acceptance beyond Bitcoin. The decision suggested regulators were willing to treat Ethereum as a mainstream investment asset despite earlier uncertainty.

Early inflows were slower than Bitcoin's, but the approvals laid the groundwork for the July ETF launches and normalized Ethereum exposure for traditional portfolios.
