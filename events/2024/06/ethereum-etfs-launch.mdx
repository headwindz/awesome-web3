On July 23, 2024, nine **spot Ethereum ETFs** begin trading on US exchanges, completing the second major milestone in crypto's institutional adoption after Bitcoin ETFs. The surprise approval validates Ethereum as more than just "Bitcoin's sidekick."

## The Launch

**Approved ETFs:**

- BlackRock's ETHA
- Fidelity's FETH
- Grayscale's ETHE (converted from trust)
- Grayscale Mini ETF
- VanEck ETHV
- 21Shares CETH
- Invesco Galaxy QETH
- Franklin EZET
- Bitwise ETHW

**Day One Trading:**

- Combined volume: $1.1 billion
- Grayscale sees $500M in outflows (high fee redemptions)
- Net inflows: ~$100M into new lower-fee products

## The Surprise Approval

**Nobody Saw It Coming:**

- May 2024: SEC requests exchanges update filings (first sign of life)
- May 23: Unexpected approval of 19b-4 forms (exchanges can list)
- July 23: Final S-1 approvals enable trading

The SEC's abrupt reversal suggests political pressure and recognizing the illogic of approving Bitcoin but not Ethereum ETFs.

## One Key Difference

Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs **cannot stake** their holdings:

- No staking rewards (~3-4% APY lost)
- Due to SEC concerns about staking as securities offering
- Makes ETH ETFs less attractive vs holding spot
- Costs Ethereum $500M+ in potential rewards

## Market Impact

**Ethereum Price:**

- Initial 10% rally on approval news
- Stabilizes around $3,500 post-launch
- Less dramatic than Bitcoin ETF impact

**Inflows:**

- First month: $1B in net inflows
- Pace slower than Bitcoin ETF launch
- Institutional adoption building gradually

## What It Means

**Validation:**

- Ethereum recognized as commodity-like asset
- Smart contract platforms gaining regulatory acceptance
- Opens door for other crypto ETF products

**Institutional Access:**

- Traditional investors can now access top two cryptos
- Wealth advisors can include in portfolios
- Retirement accounts can hold via ETFs

The double approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024 marks the year crypto went fully mainstream in traditional finance.
