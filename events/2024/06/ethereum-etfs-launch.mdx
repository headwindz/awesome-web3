On July 23, 2024, nine spot Ethereum ETFs began trading in the U.S., completing crypto's second major institutional gateway after Bitcoin ETFs. Launch day volume was solid but smaller than Bitcoin's, and Grayscale outflows offset some new inflows.

A key limitation was the lack of staking, which made ETF exposure less yield competitive than holding ETH directly. Even so, the launch validated Ethereum as an investable asset and widened access for traditional portfolios.

Why it mattered:

- It expanded regulated exposure to the top two crypto assets.
- It signaled broader acceptance of smart contract platforms.
- It set a template for future crypto ETF products.
