In early 2024, **Ethereum Layer 2 networks** experience explosive growth, collectively processing more transactions than Ethereum mainnet while slashing fees to under $0.01. The "L2 Summer" validates Ethereum's rollup-centric scaling roadmap.

## The L2 Landscape

**Major Players:**

- **Arbitrum**: 50%+ of L2 market share, $10B+ TVL
- **Optimism**: Leading "superchain" ecosystem strategy
- **Base**: Coinbase's L2, fastest growing with 1M+ daily active users
- **Polygon zkEVM**: Zero-knowledge proof rollup
- **zkSync Era**: Native account abstraction
- **Starknet**: Cairo-based ZK rollup

## Key Metrics (Feb 2024)

**Transaction Volume:**

- Combined L2 TPS: **50-100 TPS** vs Ethereum's 15 TPS
- Average L2 transaction fee: **$0.01-0.05** vs Ethereum's $5-50
- Total L2 TVL: **$35 billion** across all networks

**User Adoption:**

- 5M+ unique addresses on Base alone
- DeFi protocols expanding to L2s
- NFT marketplaces launching L2 versions
- Gaming and social apps choosing L2s

## What Changed

**Technology Maturity:**

- EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) reduces L2 costs by 10x
- Improved bridging infrastructure
- Better dev tooling and compatibility
- Shared security from Ethereum

**Application Migration:**

- Uniswap doing majority volume on L2s
- Aave launches on multiple L2s
- NFT projects expanding beyond mainnet
- New apps launching L2-first

## The Vision Realized

Ethereum's modular scaling approach delivers on the promise: the mainnet becomes a settlement and data availability layer while L2s handle execution, achieving both scalability and security.
