In early 2024, Ethereum layer 2 networks handled more transactions than mainnet while pushing fees down to pennies. The moment validated Ethereum's rollup centric scaling plan.

Major L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base attracted users and liquidity, and app teams increasingly launched L2 first. Better bridges, tooling, and the arrival of EIP 4844 made the economics work at scale.

Why it mattered:

- Ethereum proved it could scale without compromising mainnet security.
- L2s became the default venue for high volume activity.
- Low fees unlocked new consumer and social use cases.
