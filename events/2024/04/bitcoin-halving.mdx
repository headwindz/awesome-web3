On April 20, 2024, at block height **840,000**, Bitcoin undergoes its **fourth halving event**—a programmatic supply reduction that cuts mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to **3.125 BTC** per block.

## The Halving Mechanism

Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin with a predictable, deflationary issuance schedule:

- New blocks mined approximately every 10 minutes
- Halving occurs every 210,000 blocks (~4 years)
- Process continues until ~2140 when all 21 million BTC are mined

**Historical Halvings:**

| Event           | Date         | Block       | Reward        | Annual Inflation |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Genesis         | Jan 2009     | 0           | 50 BTC        | -                |
| 1st Halving     | Nov 2012     | 210,000     | 25 BTC        | ~12%             |
| 2nd Halving     | July 2016    | 420,000     | 12.5 BTC      | ~4%              |
| 3rd Halving     | May 2020     | 630,000     | 6.25 BTC      | ~1.8%            |
| **4th Halving** | **Apr 2024** | **840,000** | **3.125 BTC** | **~0.85%**       |

## Economic Significance

With this halving, Bitcoin's inflation rate drops to **~0.85% annually**—**lower than gold's ~2-3% supply growth**. This makes Bitcoin the hardest money ever created from an inflation perspective.

**Daily Issuance Impact:**

- Before: ~900 BTC/day (~$60M at $67k/BTC)
- After: ~450 BTC/day (~$30M at $67k/BTC)
- Annual reduction: ~164,250 BTC ($11B+ at $67k)

## Stock-to-Flow Model

The halving dramatically increases Bitcoin's **stock-to-flow ratio** (existing supply ÷ new production):

- Post-halving S2F: ~120
- Gold's S2F: ~60
- Silver's S2F: ~22

Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull markets:

- 2012 halving → 2013 rally to $1,100 (+9,000%)
- 2016 halving → 2017 rally to $19,700 (+2,800%)
- 2020 halving → 2021 rally to $69,000 (+650%)

## 2024 Halving Context

This halving was unique:

- **First** halving with spot Bitcoin ETFs in U.S. market
- **First** halving after El Salvador adoption
- **First** halving with major institutions (BlackRock, Fidelity) actively accumulating
- Price already at new ATH ($73k) _before_ halving (historically occurred _after_)

## Miner Economics

The halving creates intense pressure on miners:

- Revenue cut in half overnight
- Only efficient operations survive
- Hash rate briefly dips then recovers
- Transaction fees become increasingly important

This natural selection strengthens the network by ensuring only the most efficient, dedicated miners continue securing Bitcoin.
