On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs at once, ending a decade of rejections and opening Bitcoin access through traditional brokerages and retirement accounts. The launch marked Bitcoin's most important regulatory milestone since inception.

The early response was historic. Trading volumes broke ETF launch records, and major issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity brought a compliance friendly onramp for institutions and advisors. The ETFs also created persistent buying pressure relative to new BTC issuance.

Why it mattered:

- It legitimized spot Bitcoin exposure for mainstream investors.
- It reshaped market structure with steady ETF demand.
- It paved the path for Ethereum ETF approvals later in 2024.
