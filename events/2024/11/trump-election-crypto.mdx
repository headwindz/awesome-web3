Donald Trump wins the 2024 U.S. Presidential election after running on a pro-cryptocurrency platform, promising to make America the "crypto capital of the world," fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Republicans also gain control of Congress, creating a unified government favorable to crypto.
