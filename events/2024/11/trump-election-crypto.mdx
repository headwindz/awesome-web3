Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election after campaigning on a pro crypto platform and pledging regulatory clarity. Republicans also gained control of Congress, signaling a friendlier policy environment for digital assets.

Crypto markets rallied on expectations of looser enforcement, clearer rules for stablecoins, and improved banking access. The election became a major catalyst for late 2024 price momentum.
