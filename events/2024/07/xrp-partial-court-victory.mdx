On July 13, 2024, a federal judge ruled that Ripple's programmatic XRP sales on exchanges were not securities transactions, while certain institutional sales were. The split decision gave Ripple a partial win and narrowed the SEC's sweeping claims.

The ruling emphasized that how tokens are sold matters, especially whether buyers can reasonably rely on issuer efforts. Exchanges quickly relisted XRP, and the decision became a reference point for other token cases.

Why it mattered:

- It drew a legal distinction between retail and institutional token sales.
- It weakened the SEC's broad enforcement narrative.
- It provided the industry a clearer, if limited, precedent.
