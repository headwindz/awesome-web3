On August 5, 2021, Ethereum activated **EIP-1559** in the **London hard fork**, fundamentally restructuring how transaction fees work by introducing a **base fee that gets burned** instead of paid to miners—making ETH potentially **deflationary** and one of the most important protocol upgrades in blockchain history.

## What Is EIP-1559?

**The Core Change:**

Before EIP-1559:

- Users bid gas fees in **auction**
- All fees go to **miners**
- Price volatility extreme
- **Overpaying common**

After EIP-1559:

- **Base fee** set algorithmically (burned 🔥)
- **Priority tip** to validators (small)
- **Predictable pricing**
- **ETH supply decreases** during high activity

**The Formula:**

```
Transaction Fee = Base Fee (burned) + Priority Tip (to validator)
```

**Base Fee Mechanics:**

- **Algorithmically adjusted** each block
- **Target**: 50% full blocks (15M gas)
- **If block >50% full**: Base fee increases
- **If block <50% full**: Base fee decreases
- **Maximum change**: 12.5% per block

**The Burn:**

Every transaction **destroys** ETH:

- High network activity = **more ETH burned**
- If burn > issuance = **net deflationary**
- **Permanent supply reduction**

## Why It Matters

**The Problem It Solved:**

**1. Fee Unpredictability:**

Old system (first-price auction):

- User bids 100 gwei
- Block has space for 50 gwei
- User **overpays by 2x**
- Happens constantly

New system:

- Base fee is 50 gwei
- User pays exactly 50 gwei (+ small tip)
- **No overpaying**

**2. Miner Manipulation:**

Old system:

- Miners could **reject transactions** to create scarcity
- **Artificial congestion** raises fees
- Gaming possible

New system:

- Base fee **algorithmically set**
- Can't be manipulated
- More fair

**3. Economic Model:**

Old system:

- ETH issuance **~4.5%** annually
- All fees to miners
- **Perpetual inflation**

New system:

- Fees **burned** (removed from supply)
- During high activity: **Burn > issuance**
- **Net deflationary** 🔥

## The Deflationary Impact

**The Math:**

**Ethereum Issuance (Pre-Merge):**

- ~13,500 ETH/day issued to miners
- ~4.5% annual inflation

**EIP-1559 Burn (High Activity):**

- NFT mints: 5,000-15,000 ETH/day burned
- DeFi activity: 3,000-8,000 ETH/day burned
- Peak days: **20,000+ ETH burned**

**Net Effect:**

High activity days:

- **Burn > Issuance**
- ETH supply **decreases**
- First time ever

**Post-Merge (September 2022):**

- Issuance drops to **~1,700 ETH/day** (PoS)
- Burn stays same
- **Net deflationary almost always**

**The Numbers:**

**August 2021 - January 2026:**

- **4+ million ETH burned** (~$8-16B at various prices)
- **Supply would be 4M higher** without EIP-1559
- **~3.3% of supply** destroyed
- **Deflationary most days** post-Merge

## The Launch

**August 5, 2021: Block 12,965,000**

**What Happened:**

- **Smooth activation**: No issues
- **First burn**: Base fee immediately burning
- **Market reaction**: ETH pumped 20%+ in following weeks
- **Miners unhappy**: Lost fee revenue
- **Users happy**: Predictable fees

**The Controversy:**

**Miners opposed EIP-1559:**

- Lost **billions** in fee revenue
- Some threatened **51% attack** (didn't happen)
- "Show of force" mining pools considered
- Ultimately **accepted** (no choice)

**The Irony:**

Miners lost revenue **months before** being eliminated entirely by The Merge (PoS).

## The Fee Market

**How It Works in Practice:**

**Low Activity (Normal):**

- Base fee: 15-30 gwei
- Priority tip: 1-2 gwei
- Total: ~20-35 gwei
- **Affordable** for most

**High Activity (NFT mint, market crash):**

- Base fee: 200-500 gwei
- Priority tip: 10-50 gwei
- Total: 250-550 gwei
- **Very expensive**

**Extreme Activity (rare):**

- Base fee: 1,000+ gwei
- Priority tip: 100+ gwei
- Total: 1,100+ gwei
- **$100+ per transaction**

**The Benefit:**

- **Predictable**: Know base fee before sending
- **Rational**: Algorithmic, not auction chaos
- **Fairer**: No systematic overpaying

## The Ultrasound Money Meme

**The Narrative:**

Bitcoin maxis call Bitcoin **"sound money"** (fixed supply, 21M cap).

Ethereum community countered:

> **"ETH is ultrasound money"** 💸🦇

**The Logic:**

- **Bitcoin**: Capped at 21M (eventually)
- **Ethereum**: **Decreasing supply** (now)
- **Ultrasound**: More deflationary than "sound"

**The Meme:**

- **Ultrasound.money** website tracks burn
- Shows ETH supply **going down**
- Celebrates burn milestones
- Community rallying cry

**The Controversy:**

- Bitcoin maxis: "Changing supply is manipulation"
- ETH community: "Burn is natural fee market effect"
- Both sides convinced they're right

## The Economic Theory

**Why Burning Fees Is Revolutionary:**

**Traditional Assets:**

- **Stocks**: Profits to shareholders (dividends, buybacks)
- **Bonds**: Interest to holders
- **Gold**: No yield (store of value only)
- **Bitcoin**: No yield (store of value only)

**Ethereum Post-EIP-1559:**

- **Network usage** = **ETH burned**
- More activity = **Higher value per ETH**
- Holders benefit from **every transaction**
- **Productive asset** with value capture

**The Comparison:**

**Bitcoin:**

- Fixed supply: ✅
- Yield: ❌
- Value from scarcity only

**Ethereum:**

- Decreasing supply: ✅
- Yield (staking): ✅ (post-Merge)
- Value from burn: ✅
- Value from scarcity + utility

**The Argument:**

ETH becomes **better store of value** than Bitcoin because:

1. Deflationary during high use
2. Staking yield (~4%)
3. Utility driving demand

**Counter-Argument:**

Bitcoin's **unchanging monetary policy** is the point. ETH is "moving goalposts."

## The Numbers

**EIP-1559 Statistics (Aug 2021 - Jan 2026):**

**Total ETH Burned:**

- **4+ million ETH**
- Worth **$8-16 billion** (various prices)
- **~3.3% of total supply**

**Burn Rate:**

- **Average**: 2,500-3,500 ETH/day
- **Peak day**: 30,000+ ETH (OpenSea frenzy)
- **Low day**: 500 ETH (bear market, quiet)

**Top Burners (All-Time):**

1. **OpenSea**: 230,000+ ETH burned (NFT marketplace)
2. **Uniswap**: 180,000+ ETH (DEX)
3. **ETH transfers**: 170,000+ ETH (simple sends)
4. **Tether (USDT)**: 130,000+ ETH (stablecoin)
5. **MEV bots**: 100,000+ ETH (arbitrage)

**Post-Merge Impact:**

- **Before Merge**: Inflationary (except peak activity)
- **After Merge**: Deflationary **most days**
- **Net supply change**: -0.2% to -1% annually

## The Winners and Losers

**Winners:**

1. **ETH holders**: Deflationary = scarcer = (theoretically) more valuable
2. **Users**: Predictable fees, no overpaying
3. **DeFi protocols**: More stable gas cost planning
4. **Vitalik Buterin**: Massive W, designed EIP-1559

**Losers:**

1. **Miners**: Lost billions in fee revenue
2. **Bitcoin maxis**: Lost "sound money" monopoly narrative
3. **Gas abstraction projects**: Less needed with predictable fees
4. **MEV bots**: Still frontrun, but harder to profit

**The Irony:**

Miners who opposed EIP-1559 were **eliminated entirely** by The Merge 13 months later.

## The Technical Details

**EIP-1559 Includes:**

**1. BASEFEE Opcode:**

- Smart contracts can read base fee
- Enables gas-efficient logic
- Used by MEV bots, aggregators

**2. Block Size Flexibility:**

- Target: 15M gas/block
- Max: 30M gas/block (2x target)
- Allows **elasticity** during demand spikes

**3. Burn Mechanism:**

- Base fee sent to **0x000...000** address
- ETH permanently **destroyed**
- Visible on-chain

**4. Legacy Transactions:**

- Old format still works
- Auto-converted to new format
- Backward compatible

## The Market Impact

**ETH Price Action:**

**Pre-EIP-1559 (Jul 2021):**

- ETH: ~$2,000
- Anticipation building
- "Ultrasound money" hype

**Post-EIP-1559 (Aug-Nov 2021):**

- ETH: $2,000 → $4,800 (+140%)
- Deflationary narrative
- NFT boom + DeFi = massive burn

**Bear Market (2022):**

- ETH: $4,800 → $900 (-81%)
- Burn continued but less
- Macro conditions dominated

**Post-Merge (2023-2026):**

- Deflationary **most days**
- Burn + low issuance = 📉 supply
- Price: $900 → $1,000-4,000 (volatile)

**The Question:**

Did EIP-1559 increase ETH price?

**Answer:** Impossible to isolate, but:

- Narrative value: ✅
- Supply reduction: ✅
- Better UX: ✅
- Likely positive long-term

## The Criticism

**The Bear Case:**

**1. "Moving the Goalposts":**

- Bitcoin has **fixed policy**
- Ethereum changes rules
- "Can't trust it"

**Counter:** Ethereum's adaptability is a feature, not bug.

**2. "Doesn't Actually Make ETH Deflationary":**

- Only during **high activity**
- Low activity = still inflationary (pre-Merge)
- Misleading marketing

**Counter:** Post-Merge, deflationary most days. Worked as designed.

**3. "Punishes Miners":**

- Lost billions in revenue
- Unfair to change rules

**Counter:** Protocol can evolve. Miners knew risks.

**4. "Supply Manipulation":**

- Changing supply = not "sound money"
- Artificial scarcity

**Counter:** Market-driven burn, not central authority.

## The Cultural Impact

**What EIP-1559 Proved:**

1. **Ethereum can upgrade**: Major protocol change, smooth execution
2. **Community governance works**: Contentious upgrade still shipped
3. **Deflationary assets possible**: Not just fixed supply
4. **Fee markets improvable**: Better UX possible

**The Memes:**

- **"Ultrasound money"** 💸🦇
- **"Money printer go brrrr (in reverse)"** 🔥
- **"ETH is burning"** 🔥
- **"Wen deflationary?"** (answered: now)
- **Ultrasound.money** website

**The Narrative Shift:**

Before EIP-1559:

> "ETH has no supply cap. Infinite inflation."

After EIP-1559:

> "ETH is deflationary. Better than Bitcoin."

Hyperbole both times, but **narrative matters**.

## The Comparison to Bitcoin

**Bitcoin's Model:**

- **Fixed supply**: 21M cap
- **Predictable issuance**: Halving every 4 years
- **Fee market**: All fees to miners
- **No changes**: Ossified protocol
- **Philosophy**: Sound money = unchanging

**Ethereum's Model:**

- **Variable supply**: Changes based on activity
- **Dynamic issuance**: Changed multiple times
- **Fee market**: Fees burned (EIP-1559)
- **Regular upgrades**: Protocol evolves
- **Philosophy**: Ultrasound money = improving

**Which Is Better?**

**Depends on values:**

- **Value immutability**: Bitcoin wins
- **Value adaptability**: Ethereum wins
- **Value simplicity**: Bitcoin wins
- **Value utility**: Ethereum wins

Both can coexist. 🤷

## The Long-Term Vision

**Vitalik's Goal:**

EIP-1559 was step toward:

1. **Economic sustainability**: ETH has value capture mechanism
2. **User experience**: Predictable fees
3. **Deflationary asset**: Scarcity + utility
4. **Proof of Stake prep**: Easier to secure with valuable ETH

**The Roadmap:**

- ✅ EIP-1559 (Aug 2021): Fee burn
- ✅ The Merge (Sep 2022): PoS, lower issuance
- ✅ Deflationary (2022+): Combined effect working
- 🔄 Future: Sharding, rollups reduce L1 activity
- ❓ Question: If L2s reduce L1 usage, less burn?

**The L2 Tension:**

- **Goal**: Scale via Layer 2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.)
- **Effect**: Less L1 transactions
- **Result**: Less ETH burned
- **Trade-off**: Scalability vs burn rate

**The Solution:**

L2s still **settle to L1**, generating burn. Just less per user.

## The Quotes

**Vitalik Buterin:**

> "EIP-1559 is not just about burning ETH. It's about creating a better fee market and making Ethereum more sustainable."

**Miner (Anonymous):**

> "They're stealing our revenue. This is a hostile takeover by holders."

**ETH Holder:**

> "Ultrasound money baby! 🦇 Every transaction makes my ETH more scarce. Love to see it."

**Bitcoin Maxi:**

> "Ethereum changes the rules constantly. That's not sound money. That's fiat 2.0."

**DeFi User:**

> "Finally, I'm not overpaying 2x on gas because I set my fee too high. EIP-1559 is amazing for UX."

## Why It Matters

**EIP-1559 Was Pivotal Because:**

1. **Changed monetary policy**: From inflationary to deflationary
2. **Improved UX**: Predictable fees, no overpaying
3. **Value capture**: Network usage benefits holders
4. **Narrative shift**: "Ultrasound money" vs Bitcoin's "sound money"
5. **Smooth execution**: Complex upgrade, no issues

**The Comparison:**

- **The Merge** (2022): Bigger change (PoS), but expected
- **EIP-1559** (2021): Contentious, changed economics
- Both critical to **Ethereum 2.0** vision

**The Legacy:**

EIP-1559 is **one of the most important** upgrades in blockchain history:

- Changed fee markets forever
- Made deflationary tokenomics mainstream
- Proved protocol economics can evolve
- Set template for future upgrades

**The Final Analysis:**

**Did EIP-1559 work?**

✅ **Technical**: Flawless execution
✅ **UX**: Better fee predictability
✅ **Economic**: ETH now deflationary (post-Merge)
✅ **Narrative**: "Ultrasound money" resonates
❓ **Price impact**: Hard to isolate, likely positive

**Verdict:** Massive success. 🔥

**The Irony:**

Ethereum became **more deflationary** than Bitcoin (fixed supply) by **burning fees**.

Sometimes the best way to create scarcity is to **destroy value**. 🔥💎
