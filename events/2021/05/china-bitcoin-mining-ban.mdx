On May 21, 2021, China's State Council signaled a broad crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading. The announcement kicked off a rapid shutdown of mining farms and a historic redistribution of hash rate.

Miners shut down across multiple provinces, and Bitcoin's hash rate dropped roughly in half within weeks. The move caused short‑term fear in markets, but it also created a windfall for miners who stayed online, as difficulty adjusted downward. Equipment poured into the U.S., Kazakhstan, Canada, and other destinations, turning the ban into a global migration of mining infrastructure.

By late 2021 and early 2022, the network had recovered its hash rate and become more geographically diverse. The episode reinforced Bitcoin's resilience: even when the largest mining country unplugged, the protocol kept running and adapted automatically.
