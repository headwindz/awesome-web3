On September 24, 2021, the People's Bank of China declared **all cryptocurrency transactions illegal**, completing a multi‑year crackdown on mining, exchanges, and trading. It was the most sweeping ban issued by any major economy.

The announcement blocked foreign exchanges, banned crypto‑related business activity, and formalized a shift toward the digital yuan. Markets dipped briefly, but the global industry adapted quickly. Trading and innovation moved further offshore, and Chinese users migrated to VPNs and peer‑to‑peer channels.

Ironically, the ban accelerated decentralization. By this point, mining had already fled China due to the earlier crackdown, and trading volume had shifted elsewhere. The network kept running, and the ecosystem became less dependent on any single country.

China's final ban marked the end of its direct influence over global crypto markets, but it did not stop crypto itself. It globalized it.
