On April 14, 2021, the U.S. Senate confirmed **Gary Gensler** as SEC Chair. The former MIT blockchain professor quickly became the most aggressive crypto regulator in U.S. history, pushing a strategy widely described as "regulation by enforcement."

Early optimism faded as the SEC brought a wave of actions against exchanges, token issuers, and crypto lending products. The agency argued that most tokens were securities and that many platforms operated as unregistered exchanges. Critics said the SEC offered little guidance on how to comply, leaving companies to learn the rules through lawsuits.

The enforcement era reshaped the industry. Some firms left the U.S. or restricted services to American users. Others fought in court, producing partial wins that clarified the limits of SEC authority. The result was a more cautious U.S. market and a growing push for legislative clarity.

Gensler's tenure defined crypto regulation in the early 2020s: aggressive, contentious, and central to the industry's political identity.
