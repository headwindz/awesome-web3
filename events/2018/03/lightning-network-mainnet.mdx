On March 15, 2018, the Lightning Network went live on Bitcoin mainnet. It introduced off-chain payment channels that settle back to Bitcoin, enabling instant, low-fee transfers without changing the base layer. The launch proved Bitcoin could scale through layers.

Why it mattered:

- Delivered practical scaling without larger blocks
- Expanded Bitcoin from settlement to everyday payments
- Validated the Layer 2 model for Bitcoin

## The Infrastructure Challenge

**Early Problems:**

- Channel management complexity
- Liquidity provisioning difficulties
- Limited wallet support
- Hub-and-spoke centralizes risk
- UX barriers to adoption

**But also had backers:**

- Technical viability proven
- Real usage cases emerging (El Salvador remittances)
- Network growing steadily
- Still very early stage

## Progress Over Time

**2018-2019**: Hobbyist experiments  
**2020-2021**: Better wallets, El Salvador adoption drives volume  
**2022-2023**: Exchange integration, Nostr zaps, podcasting payments  
**2024**: 5K+ BTC capacity, improved UX, growing real usage

## The Verdict

**Partial success:**

- Technically works
- Growing adoption
- Enabled new use cases
- Still not mainstream
- Scaling isn't solved, just deferred

Lightning proved Layer 2 scaling is possible, but also revealed the complexity of building user-friendly infrastructure on Bitcoin. It remains a viable complement to on-chain, not a replacement.

**The lesson:** Ambitious infrastructure takes decades. Lightning is solving hard problems incrementally, proving Bitcoin's flexibility without requiring consensus changes.
