On October 7, 2011, Charlie Lee launched Litecoin as a faster, lighter variant of Bitcoin with 2.5 minute blocks and a larger fixed supply. It quickly became the first altcoin to achieve lasting adoption.

Litecoin's fair launch, active community, and early exchange listings helped it survive multiple cycles. It also served as a testing ground for upgrades like SegWit and Lightning before Bitcoin deployed them.

Why it mattered:

- It proved that alternative cryptocurrencies could sustain real markets.
- It established the "digital silver" narrative alongside Bitcoin's gold.
- It opened the door to a broader multi chain ecosystem.
