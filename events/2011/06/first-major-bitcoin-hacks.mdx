In June 2011, Mt. Gox was hacked and the Bitcoin price briefly crashed to a penny. It was the first major exchange breach and a brutal introduction to custodial risk.

Other incidents followed that year, including Bitomat and MyBitcoin losses, which highlighted how fragile early exchange security was. These failures seeded the core lesson: the protocol can be secure even when custodians are not.

Why it mattered:

- It birthed the mantra "not your keys, not your coins."
- It pushed the industry toward cold storage and better custody.
- It foreshadowed later exchange collapses like Mt. Gox in 2014.
