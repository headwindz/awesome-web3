On January 14, 2019, **QuadrigaCX** announced its founder, **Gerald Cotten**, had died in India, taking with him the only keys to **$190 million** in customer funds. The story unraveled into one of crypto's strangest fraud sagas, with empty wallets, fake trails, and a vanished fortune that was never there.

The official narrative was dramatic: Cotten, 30, died in December 2018 from complications related to Crohn's disease. He allegedly controlled the exchange's cold wallets alone, and the passwords died with him. Canada’s largest exchange, serving roughly 115,000 customers, claimed the assets were now permanently locked. The timing felt suspicious and the single point of failure was absurd for a business of that size.

Investigators quickly found that the cold wallets were mostly empty. Funds had been moved long before Cotten’s death, and blockchain forensics revealed patterns consistent with fraud. Customer deposits had been commingled with exchange funds, shuffled between wallets to fake liquidity, and used in a Ponzi-like loop to cover withdrawals. Cotten gambled user funds on other exchanges, lost heavily, and masked the deficits with new deposits. His lavish lifestyle, funded by customer money, raised even more alarms.

The death itself became part of the mystery. The certificate contained inconsistencies, and rumors spread that Cotten may have staged his death. His widow inherited a sizable estate and claimed she knew nothing of the fraud. In the end, customers recovered only a small fraction of their funds.

Quadriga’s collapse exposed how little oversight crypto exchanges had at the time: no audits, no proof of reserves, no robust custody controls. It became a case study for why centralized intermediaries are risky and why the mantra "not your keys, not your coins" matters. The incident pushed the industry toward better custody practices, proof-of-reserves audits, and more aggressive regulatory scrutiny, but the damage to trust was permanent.
