On June 18, 2019, **Facebook** (now Meta) announced **Libra**, a proposed global stablecoin for its **2.7 billion users**. The backlash was immediate and overwhelming, and the project was effectively dead by 2022.

Libra promised a low‑volatility currency backed by a basket of fiat reserves, governed by the **Libra Association** with major partners like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, and Spotify. It would run on a new blockchain, use the Move language, and aim for fast, low‑fee payments. The pitch was financial inclusion: a global currency embedded in Facebook and WhatsApp, especially for the unbanked.

Regulators saw something else: a private corporation with the potential to issue a currency larger than most nation‑states. Within days, politicians demanded hearings, central banks warned of systemic risk, and regulators made it clear Libra would not launch without heavy oversight. Facebook’s poor privacy reputation amplified the hostility.

By late 2019, major partners began to exit under regulatory pressure. The project rebranded to **Diem** in 2020, scaled down to a single‑currency stablecoin, and promised closer cooperation. It still couldn’t escape scrutiny. In January 2022, Diem sold its assets to Silvergate, ending the project.

Libra’s failure reshaped the global conversation about stablecoins and monetary sovereignty. It pushed regulators to accelerate CBDC research and reinforced that large‑scale private money would face intense resistance. The project never launched, but it left a lasting impact on how governments view tech‑company‑issued currencies.
