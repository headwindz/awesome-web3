On September 23, 2019, **Bakkt**, backed by **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**, launched **physically settled Bitcoin futures**. Unlike cash‑settled products, Bakkt delivered real BTC, signaling Wall Street’s first serious infrastructure push into crypto.

Bakkt was built as an institutional‑grade platform with CFTC‑regulated custody and a warehouse for holding Bitcoin. Its daily and monthly futures contracts settled in actual Bitcoin, a key difference from CME’s cash‑settled futures. The message was clear: this wasn’t just a speculative paper product, it was a bridge for traditional finance to interact with real BTC.

The launch was hyped, then underwhelming. First‑day volume was only **71 BTC**, and the price barely moved. Critics mocked the “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect, but the bigger story was infrastructure. Building regulated custody, settlement, and compliance pipelines takes time.

In the long run, Bakkt established a regulatory template and helped normalize institutional custody. It didn’t trigger immediate price fireworks, but it signaled that Wall Street was building plumbing for Bitcoin, not just trading it. That infrastructure became part of the slow but steady shift toward institutional participation that accelerated in the following years.
