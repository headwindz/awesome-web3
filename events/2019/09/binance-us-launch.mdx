On September 24, 2019, **Binance.US** officially launched as a separate, US-compliant cryptocurrency exchange, marking **Binance's strategic response to American regulatory pressure** and its commitment to serving the world's largest crypto market under proper oversight.

## The Background

**Why Binance Needed a US Entity:**

- **CFTC/SEC Scrutiny**: US regulators investigating Binance's American users
- **Unlicensed Operation**: Global Binance operated without US money transmitter licenses
- **VPN Workarounds**: Americans using VPNs to access global platform
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential enforcement actions and penalties

## The Solution: Separate Entity

**Binance.US Structure:**

- **Separate company**: BAM Trading Services
- **US-based**: San Francisco headquarters
- **State licenses**: Applied for money transmitter licenses in 50 states
- **Limited tokens**: Far fewer cryptocurrencies than global Binance
- **Higher fees**: To cover compliance costs
- **No BNB staking**: Regulatory uncertainty around staking

**What Was NOT Available:**

- Margin trading
- Derivatives
- Futures
- Many altcoins deemed securities
- Services to certain restricted states (NY, TX, HI initially)

## The Announcement

**CZ's Statement (June 2019):**

> "We are committed to working with regulators and policymakers to shape policy that protects consumers and encourages further blockchain innovation. We believe that this new platform will be a key part of our efforts to bring the benefits of blockchain to the US."

**September 2019 Launch:**

- Started with 6 states
- 30+ cryptocurrencies
- Bank partnerships for USD deposits
- FinCEN registered

## Market Impact

**Industry Significance:**

1. **Legitimacy Play**

   - Showed major exchanges willing to comply
   - Separated "offshore" from "onshore" operations
   - Set precedent for other international exchanges

2. **User Experience Split**

   - Americans forced to choose: VPN global Binance or compliant US version
   - Frustration over limited features
   - Some users moved offshore entirely

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Challenged Coinbase's US dominance
   - Lower fees than established US exchanges
   - Binance brand recognition

## Controversies

**Issues from Day One:**

- **Geofencing complaints**: Americans abroad couldn't access
- **Feature limitations**: Derivatives traders abandoned platform
- **State-by-state rollout**: Slow expansion across US
- **NY exclusion**: No Binance.US in New York for years

## The Longer Story

**What Came After:**

- **2020-2021**: Gradual state expansion
- **2021**: Attempted $8 billion FTX.US acquisition deal (failed)
- **2022-2023**: DOJ investigation of Binance (including US entity)
- **2023**: SEC lawsuit against Binance and Binance.US
- **2024**: CEO Brian Shroder resigned amid legal troubles

## Why It Matters

Binance.US represented crypto's "dual track" strategy:

1. **Offshore platforms** with maximum features and minimal compliance
2. **Onshore platforms** with regulatory approval but limited functionality

This model became the blueprint for how international crypto companies approached the US market:

- Kraken → Kraken US
- Huobi → HBUS (failed)
- OKEx → (never launched US version)

The launch also foreshadowed the **regulatory fragmentation** that would define crypto in the 2020s:

- Different rules per country
- Separate entities per jurisdiction
- Compliance as competitive disadvantage
- Offshore arbitrage opportunities

Despite its compromises, Binance.US showed that even the most powerful crypto exchange couldn't ignore US regulators forever—and that serving American customers required playing by American rules, even if those rules were still being written.
