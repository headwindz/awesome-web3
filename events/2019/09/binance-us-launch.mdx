On September 24, 2019, **Binance.US** launched as a separate, U.S.-compliant exchange, marking Binance’s attempt to keep American users while playing by local rules.

The move was driven by regulatory pressure. Global Binance operated offshore and lacked U.S. money‑transmitter licenses, while Americans accessed it via VPNs. The risk of enforcement was rising. Binance created **BAM Trading Services** to run Binance.US, registered with FinCEN, and began a state‑by‑state licensing process.

The compliant version came with trade‑offs: fewer listed tokens, no margin or derivatives, and limited availability in certain states. It launched with a small number of assets and slowly expanded, competing with Coinbase on fees while offering a more restricted product set than Binance’s global platform.

Binance.US embodied crypto’s dual‑track strategy: offshore platforms with full features versus onshore entities with compliance constraints. It foreshadowed the regulatory fragmentation that would define the 2020s, where major exchanges had to build jurisdiction‑specific products and accept reduced functionality to serve U.S. customers.

The story also carried longer‑term turbulence. U.S. investigations and lawsuits eventually targeted both Binance and its U.S. arm, and leadership changes followed. Even so, the 2019 launch was a key moment in crypto’s gradual shift toward regulatory accommodation in the world’s largest capital market.
