In early 2019, **Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs)** emerged as the post‑ICO reset, with **Binance Launchpad** leading the charge. The pitch was simple: exchanges would vet projects, handle compliance, and provide instant liquidity, offering a “safer” path to fundraising after the ICO crash.

The early results were explosive. BitTorrent (BTT) sold out in minutes, Fetch.AI (FET) sold out in seconds, and Celer Network (CELR) followed with strong demand. Participation often required holding exchange tokens like BNB, driving their prices higher and creating a new feedback loop between fundraising and exchange ecosystems.

The model had real advantages. Exchanges handled KYC/AML, offered immediate trading, and put their reputations on the line. But it also created new problems: allocations skewed toward whales, bots gamed lottery systems, and many tokens dumped immediately after listing. Exchanges gained outsized power over which projects could raise money, and conflicts of interest became hard to ignore.

IEOs were crypto’s attempt at self‑regulation without government mandates. The boom was short‑lived, but it bridged the gap between the wild ICO era and the later rise of DeFi-driven fundraising models like IDOs. By the end of 2019, the frenzy cooled, but the core idea—exchange‑mediated token sales—remains part of crypto’s fundraising toolkit.
