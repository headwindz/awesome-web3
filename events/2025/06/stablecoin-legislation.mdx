The U.S. Congress passes comprehensive stablecoin legislation, providing the first clear regulatory framework for dollar-backed digital currencies. The bill establishes reserve requirements, licensing standards, and oversight mechanisms while explicitly authorizing federally-regulated stablecoins.

This landmark legislation removes years of regulatory uncertainty and is expected to unleash innovation in payments and DeFi. Major payment companies and banks announce plans to launch compliant stablecoins, potentially integrating crypto rails into mainstream finance.
