SEC Chair Gary Gensler announces his resignation effective January 20, 2025, coinciding with the inauguration of President Trump. Gensler's tenure was marked by aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies, including lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance, and Ripple, while refusing to provide regulatory clarity.
