President Trump signs a comprehensive executive order on digital assets within days of taking office. The order establishes a working group to develop clear crypto regulations, directs agencies to support blockchain innovation, and explores the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The order reverses years of hostile regulatory policy and signals the U.S. government's intent to embrace rather than suppress cryptocurrency innovation. Markets rally on the news, with Bitcoin surging to new highs above $108,000.
