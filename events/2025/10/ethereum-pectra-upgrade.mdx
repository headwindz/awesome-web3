Ethereum implements the Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra consensus layer improvements. Key features include increasing the maximum validator stake from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH, improving validator experience, and enabling account abstraction at the protocol level.

The upgrade makes Ethereum more user-friendly with features like social recovery, gas sponsorship, and batch transactions. Enhanced staking flexibility allows larger institutions to operate more efficiently while maintaining decentralization.
