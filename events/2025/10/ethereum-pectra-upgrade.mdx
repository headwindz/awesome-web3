On October 15, 2025, Ethereum deployed the Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra changes. The update raised the maximum validator stake and introduced protocol level account abstraction features aimed at better UX.

Pectra improved staking operations while enabling features like gas sponsorship and batch transactions, helping wallets and apps deliver smoother onboarding.

Why it mattered:

- It streamlined validator operations at scale.
- It brought account abstraction closer to default user experience.
- It made Ethereum more usable without changing core security.
