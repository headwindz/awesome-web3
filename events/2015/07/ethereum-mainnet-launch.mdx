On July 30, 2015, **Ethereum mainnet** switched on at block #1. The "world computer" stopped being a whitepaper and became running code. For the first time, developers could deploy smart contracts on a live, global blockchain rather than just move coins from A to B.

Ethereum's pitch was ambitious: a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform where code could execute automatically without a central server. Instead of creating a new chain for every use case, Ethereum would be a single programmable base layer. Its core innovations were the **Ethereum Virtual Machine**, the **Solidity** programming language, and a **gas** system that priced computation to prevent spam and infinite loops. It launched with proof-of-work consensus, a ~15-second block time, and an initial supply of roughly 72 million ETH from the presale and genesis allocation.

The early network was raw and experimental. The release name, **Frontier**, signaled this was the first frontier outpost: usable, but not yet polished. Still, it worked, and that was the breakthrough. Within a few years, Ethereum became the foundation for decentralized finance, NFTs, DAOs, stablecoins, and Layer 2 scaling networks. The mainnet launch proved that blockchains could be general-purpose platforms, not just payment rails, and it reset the industry's expectations about what crypto could build.
