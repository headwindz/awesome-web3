On July 30, 2015, **Ethereum mainnet** goes live at block #1, bringing programmable smart contracts to blockchain for the first time. What began as a whitepaper by 19-year-old Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 becomes reality, expanding blockchain's potential far beyond Bitcoin's peer-to-peer cash system.

## The Vision

Ethereum introduced the concept of a **"world computer"**—a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform where anyone could deploy unstoppable applications. Instead of being limited to currency transactions, developers could now write arbitrary code that executes automatically when conditions are met.

## Key Innovations

- **Turing-complete smart contracts** - Programs that can handle any computational task
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** - The runtime environment for smart contracts
- **Solidity programming language** - Purpose-built for writing smart contracts
- **Gas system** - Economic mechanism to prevent spam and infinite loops
- **Account model** - More flexible than Bitcoin's UTXO model

## Initial Parameters

- **Block time**: ~15 seconds (vs Bitcoin's 10 minutes)
- **Initial supply**: ~72 million ETH from presale + genesis
- **Consensus**: Proof-of-Work (Ethash algorithm)
- **Block reward**: 5 ETH per block

The launch unlocked a Cambrian explosion of innovation. Within years, Ethereum became the foundation for:

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
- Stablecoins and tokenization
- Layer 2 scaling solutions

Ethereum proved that blockchains could be general-purpose platforms, not just payment networks, forever changing the trajectory of the industry.
