On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin's block reward fell from 50 to 25 BTC at block 210,000. The network kept running, proving the supply schedule could execute exactly as written.

The cut in new issuance did not trigger an immediate price spike, but it anchored the four-year halving narrative that later cycles would reinforce.

Why it mattered:

- It validated Bitcoin's programmed monetary policy.
- It tested miner economics under a sudden revenue cut.
- It established the halving as a recurring market event.
- It strengthened the scarcity thesis that drives long-term demand.

This is why Bitcoin believers believe. This is why "diamond hands" exist. This is why people hold through 80% crashes.

**Because every 4 years, the code executes. Supply gets cut. And history rhymes.**

The first halving established the pattern. Everything since has been repetition with higher numbers.

**Block 210,000** was Bitcoin's promise kept.  
**Every halving since has been that promise repeated.**

And Bitcoin has never broken its promise.
