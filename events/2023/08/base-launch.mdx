On August 9, 2023, Coinbase launched Base, an Ethereum L2 built on the OP Stack. It was the first time a major public company launched its own chain, signaling a corporate push to bring users onchain at scale.

Base offered low fees, tight Coinbase onramp integration, and immediate developer interest. Early activity surged alongside Coinbase's "Onchain Summer" push and consumer apps like friend.tech.

Why it mattered:

- Coinbase used its distribution and compliance posture to bootstrap an L2.
- The OP Stack partnership reinforced the superchain model.
- It showed how consumer apps could thrive with cheaper Ethereum execution.
