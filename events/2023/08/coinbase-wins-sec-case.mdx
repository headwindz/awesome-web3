On August 29, 2023, a federal judge dismissed parts of the SEC's case against Coinbase, narrowing the scope of the regulator's claims. The ruling trimmed allegations tied to Coinbase Wallet and staking while letting the core exchange listing claims continue.

Why it mattered:

- It signaled that not every crypto product fits the broker or securities mold.
- It pushed back on regulation by enforcement without ending the case.
- It gave the industry a clearer litigation roadmap.

Markets reacted positively, but the decision was partial, not a full victory. The lawsuit continued with the exchange listing issues at the center.
