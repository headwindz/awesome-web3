In January 2023, Casey Rodarmor released Ordinals, enabling data inscriptions on individual satoshis. The protocol brought NFT like collectibles to Bitcoin without smart contracts and sparked a sharp debate over Bitcoin's purpose.

Supporters saw permissionless creativity and stronger miner fees, while critics saw block space spam. The protocol was hard to stop without censoring valid transactions, so usage became the arbiter.

Why it mattered:

- It expanded Bitcoin's narrative beyond store of value.
- It created fee surges that tightened block space.
- It split the community on whether Bitcoin should host non monetary use cases.
- Working as designed (even if unintended)

## The Bigger Picture

Ordinals are the latest chapter in Bitcoin's evolution:

- 2009: Peer-to-peer cash
- 2013: Digital gold
- 2017: Store of value
- 2021: Institutional asset
- 2023: **Digital artifacts platform**

Each phase expands Bitcoin's narrative without breaking the previous ones. **Bitcoin contains multitudes.**

The question isn't whether Ordinals "belong" on Bitcoin. They exist. They're valid transactions. The market will decide their long-term value.

**Bitcoin's beauty: It doesn't care what you think it should be used for.** You pay fees, you use it. That's the only rule that matters.

Ordinals are Bitcoin's latest stress test. And like every previous test, **Bitcoin keeps ticking. Block after block. Every 10 minutes.**
