On June 15, 2023, **BlackRock** - the world's largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in AUM - files for a spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a watershed moment for crypto's institutional legitimacy. The filing signals a dramatic shift in Wall Street's stance toward Bitcoin.

## Why This Matters

**BlackRock's Track Record:**

- 575 previous ETF filings with SEC
- **99.8% approval rate** (only one rejection in history)
- Unparalleled regulatory relationships and experience

**The Domino Effect:**

Within weeks of BlackRock's filing, a wave of traditional finance firms follow:

- Fidelity refiles amended application
- Invesco and Galaxy Digital file jointly
- VanEck updates previous filing
- ARK Invest and 21Shares refile
- Valkyrie, WisdomTree, and others join

**What Changed:**

BlackRock's filing includes a novel **surveillance-sharing agreement** with Coinbase, addressing SEC's primary concern about market manipulation - a structure other filers quickly adopt.

## Market Impact

Bitcoin rallies 25% in the following weeks on optimism that approval is now inevitable. The crypto industry recognizes this as the moment institutional adoption became unstoppable.

The filings ultimately lead to approval in January 2024, unleashing massive capital inflows and pushing Bitcoin to new all-time highs.
