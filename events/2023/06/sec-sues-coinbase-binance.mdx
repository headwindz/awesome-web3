In early June 2023, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, alleging they operated unregistered exchanges, brokers, and clearing agencies and listed unregistered securities. The Binance complaint also alleged commingling of customer and corporate funds and misleading controls.

The lawsuits hit token prices and raised a central question: which crypto assets fall under securities law and what compliant exchange model looks like in the US.

Why it mattered:

- It formalized the SEC's broad view of many tokens as securities.
- It put core exchange revenue lines like listing, staking, and custody under legal risk.
- It increased pressure on Congress to define a crypto market structure.
- It nudged activity offshore while US litigation played out.
