On November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board fired CEO Sam Altman, sparking a five day governance crisis that ended with his return and a board overhaul. The episode briefly moved Worldcoin's token, highlighting how Web2 leadership drama can spill into crypto markets.

Why it mattered:

- It exposed governance stress in high stakes AI companies.
- It showed how closely AI and crypto narratives are now linked.
- It added volatility to Worldcoin, Altman's crypto identity project.
