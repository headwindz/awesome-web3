On November 21, 2023, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities and pleaded guilty to criminal charges tied to AML and sanctions compliance. Founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to a Bank Secrecy Act violation.

The agreement required a multi year compliance monitor and significant operational changes. Unlike FTX, customer funds were not alleged to be stolen, but the case underscored that regulatory failures can still bring massive penalties.

Why it mattered:

- It established that U.S. enforcement can reach offshore exchanges serving U.S. users.
- It made compliance a competitive necessity, not a nice to have.
- It held a top tier founder personally accountable.
