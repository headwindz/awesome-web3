Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapses, creating a crisis in the crypto industry as Circle, issuer of USDC stablecoin, reveals $3.3 billion of its reserves were held at SVB. USDC briefly de-pegs from the dollar, dropping to $0.87, causing panic across DeFi protocols that rely on it as collateral.

The Federal Reserve's intervention and FDIC takeover restored stability, but the event highlighted the interconnection between traditional finance and crypto, and the systemic risks of centralized stablecoins. It accelerated development of decentralized stablecoin alternatives.
