Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023, and Circle disclosed that $3.3 billion of USDC reserves were held at SVB. USDC briefly broke its peg, trading near $0.87, which sent shockwaves through DeFi protocols that treat it as core collateral.

A federal backstop for depositors restored confidence and USDC returned to parity, but the episode reminded markets that stablecoins depend on traditional banking rails.

Key takeaways:

- Reserve concentration risk can destabilize even large stablecoins.
- DeFi systems inherit the fragility of off chain custodians.
- Issuers accelerated efforts to diversify reserves and improve transparency.
