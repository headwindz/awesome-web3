On November 8, 2025, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, proposing that the U.S. acquire up to one million BTC over several years and hold it as a long term strategic reserve asset.

The proposal framed Bitcoin as digital gold, funded through asset reallocation rather than new taxes. It sparked immediate debate about volatility, custody risk, and whether government should hold crypto, while also signaling that Bitcoin had entered national policy discussions.

Why it mattered:

- It put a formal U.S. Bitcoin reserve on the legislative agenda.
- It raised the prospect of international reserve competition.
- It highlighted the shift from fringe asset to strategic consideration.
