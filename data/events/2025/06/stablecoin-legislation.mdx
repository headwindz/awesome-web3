On June 18, 2025, Congress passed comprehensive stablecoin legislation, creating a federal framework for dollar backed stablecoins. The law set reserve requirements, licensing standards, and oversight rules while explicitly authorizing compliant issuers.

The clarity reduced regulatory uncertainty and signaled that stablecoins were moving into the mainstream payments stack.

Why it mattered:

- It created the first clear U.S. rule set for stablecoins.
- It encouraged banks and payment firms to launch compliant products.
- It strengthened trust in reserve backed digital dollars.
