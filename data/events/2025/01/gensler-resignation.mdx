Gary Gensler resigned as SEC chair on January 20, 2025, ending a period defined by aggressive crypto enforcement and limited rulemaking guidance. The timing aligned with the incoming Trump administration.

The industry read the move as a reset toward clearer regulation, with expectations of a more supportive SEC leadership team.

Why it mattered:

- It closed a chapter of regulation by enforcement.
- It raised expectations for clearer crypto rulemaking.
