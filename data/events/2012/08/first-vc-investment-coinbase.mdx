In August 2012, Coinbase joined Y Combinator and raised a $150K seed round. At the time, Bitcoin was a niche experiment, and the YC stamp signaled that crypto startups could be legitimate venture bets.

The investment helped Coinbase raise follow on funding and catalyzed a broader wave of VC interest that built the modern crypto startup ecosystem.

Why it mattered:

- It validated crypto as a venture backed industry.
- It kickstarted a funding pipeline for Web3 startups.
- It set the stage for Coinbase's later IPO and mainstream adoption.
