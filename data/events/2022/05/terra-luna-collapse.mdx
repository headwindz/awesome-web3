In May 2022, Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its peg and triggered a rapid death spiral that wiped out more than $40 billion in value. The collapse shattered confidence in algorithmic stablecoins and seeded a wave of crypto contagion.

Terra's design linked UST to LUNA: users could mint 1 UST by burning $1 of LUNA, or redeem UST for $1 of LUNA. The peg was supposed to hold through arbitrage, while Anchor Protocol attracted deposits with a 20 percent yield. That yield relied on subsidies and constant inflows.

When large UST exits hit liquidity pools in early May, the peg slipped. Redemptions exploded, LUNA supply inflated into the trillions, and both tokens collapsed within days. The Terra chain halted; investors were wiped out; and funds that had been exposed to UST or LUNA faced huge losses.

Why it broke:

- The peg depended on confidence and constant demand.
- The yield was unsustainable without fresh capital.
- There were no circuit breakers for a fast-moving bank run.

Afterward, Terraform Labs proposed a rebooted chain without the algorithmic stablecoin. Regulators accelerated stablecoin scrutiny, and algorithmic designs lost mainstream credibility. Terra became a lasting cautionary tale about financial engineering that works in a bull market but collapses when trust evaporates.
