In November 2022, FTX collapsed almost overnight. The exchange had been valued at $32 billion and was widely viewed as a safe, regulated face of crypto. A report on Alameda Research's balance sheet sparked a bank run, and within days FTX halted withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy.

Investigators later concluded that customer funds were commingled and used to prop up Alameda's trading losses. The fallout spread quickly: lenders and funds with FTX exposure failed, and the credibility of centralized exchanges took a deep hit.

Why it mattered:

- It exposed basic custody failures at a top tier exchange.
- It accelerated regulatory pressure across jurisdictions.
- It popularized proof of reserves and stricter transparency demands.

Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted in 2023 and sentenced in 2024. FTX became crypto's Lehman moment not because it was the first failure, but because it was the most trusted one. The episode ended the industry's tolerance for opaque balance sheets and made segregation of customer funds a non negotiable standard.
