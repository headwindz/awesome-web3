On June 13, 2022, Celsius froze withdrawals, and within days Three Arrows Capital was exposed as insolvent. Together, they triggered a rapid wave of lender failures across crypto.

Celsius had promised high yields while taking illiquid positions, and 3AC had borrowed heavily to make concentrated bets. When Terra collapsed and prices fell, both models broke at the same time, leaving customers locked out.

Why it mattered:

- It exposed hidden leverage across centralized lenders.
- It discredited yield promises without transparent risk.
- It intensified calls for proof of reserves and clearer disclosures.
- It accelerated the shift toward self-custody and on-chain transparency.
