In March 2022, the Ronin Bridge used by Axie Infinity was drained of about $625 million in ETH and USDC. Attackers gained control of five of nine validator keys and used a lingering permission to approve fraudulent withdrawals. The breach went undetected for days and was later attributed to North Korea's Lazarus Group.

The hack shattered trust in Axie's economy, cratered token prices, and helped end the play-to-earn boom. It also became a defining lesson about bridge security and operational risk.

Why it mattered:

- It showed how small validator sets can be a single point of failure.
- It made bridge security a top industry priority.
- It highlighted nation-state involvement in crypto theft.
- It accelerated skepticism toward play-to-earn models.
