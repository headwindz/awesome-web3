On September 25, 2013, Grayscale launched GBTC, giving traditional investors a way to get Bitcoin exposure without handling private keys. It became the dominant pre-ETF vehicle for institutional access.

As a closed-end trust, GBTC often traded at a premium to net asset value and later at a deep discount once redemptions were not allowed. That cycle shaped institutional trading and pushed Grayscale to convert GBTC into a spot ETF, which finally happened in 2024 alongside broader ETF approvals.

Why it mattered:

- It provided the first widely used Wall Street wrapper for Bitcoin.
- It proved institutional demand for regulated access.
- It highlighted the risks of closed-end crypto vehicles.
- It helped set the stage for true spot ETFs.
