On November 27, 2013, Bitcoin hit $1,000 for the first time, driven by crisis headlines, Chinese demand, and rising media attention. The milestone vaulted Bitcoin into mainstream awareness.

The rally was followed by sharp reversals tied to China restrictions and Mt. Gox problems, setting the pattern of explosive bull runs followed by deep drawdowns.

Why it mattered:

- It established Bitcoin as a global, speculative asset class.
- It showcased both upside and extreme volatility.
- It helped define the boom and bust rhythm that followed.

The 2013 run to $1,000 was Bitcoin's coming-out party. It announced to the world that this "internet money" experiment might be something real. The subsequent 2014-2015 crash tested whether it would survive.

It did. And each cycle repeated the pattern at higher magnitudes.
