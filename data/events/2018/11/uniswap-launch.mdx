On November 2, 2018, Uniswap v1 launched with a simple formula: x × y = k. It replaced order books with liquidity pools and made permissionless token swaps accessible. The quiet deployment by Hayden Adams launched a revolution.

Why it mattered:

- Proved AMMs could deliver real liquidity without intermediaries
- Turned DEXs from experiments into core infrastructure
- Became launchpad for new tokens and DeFi protocols

## The Genesis

Hayden Adams learned Solidity after getting laid off from Siemens. He received a $100K Ethereum Foundation grant and solo-built Uniswap v1. It was a quiet release with no fanfare—just code that worked.

## The Impact

**The Simple Formula:**
Three variables, one equation, changed crypto forever. While competitors built complex orderbook systems, Uniswap succeeded through simplicity and permissionless design.

**Network Effects:**

- Became DeFi primitive, enabling composable protocols
- Inspired dozens of AMM variations (Curve, Balancer, Bancor)
- Created money legos ecosystem
- Enabled aggregators (1inch, Matcha)
- Provided price feeds for other protocols

**From 2018 to Today:**

- Unknown launch → $2+ trillion in volume
- Most used DeFi protocol
- Hayden's holdings worth billions
- Killed orderbook model
- Proved decentralization works

**The lesson:** Best technology often isn't the most complex—it's the most usable. Combine that with permissionless access and true decentralization, and you get something unstoppable. Uniswap is crypto's killer app.
