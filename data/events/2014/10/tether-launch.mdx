On October 6, 2014, Tether launched on Bitcoin's Omni Layer with a simple promise: 1 USDT = 1 USD. It converted a practical friction point into core infrastructure, becoming crypto's most traded asset and default settlement currency.

Before Tether, traders faced a choice: leave exchanges to move fiat (slow, expensive) or hold volatile assets. USDT solved this by enabling instant dollar-like settlement 24/7. It spread across chains and became foundational to both CEX and DeFi ecosystems.

Why it mattered:

- Enabled 24/7 trading without bank wires
- Became the primary trading pair across exchanges
- Shaped stablecoin regulation debates

## Why USDT Dominated

**Network Effects:**

- Listed everywhere, deepest liquidity, most trading pairs
- First-mover advantage in a winner-take-most market
- Traders stick with what works

**Regulatory Arbitrage:**

- Offshore structure, fewer KYC requirements
- Faster adoption than compliant alternatives (USDC, BUSD)
- Appeals to DeFi users

**Track Record:**

- Survived 10 years without failed redemptions
- Weathered Luna collapse, FTX collapse, repeated scrutiny
- Lindy effect: if it didn't collapse yet, traders believe it won't

## The Controversy

Tether is probably not fully backed as claimed, but neither is a complete fraud. It operates as a fractional reserve system. If Tether collapsed:

- $100B+ market cap evaporates
- Cascading liquidations across exchanges
- Possible crypto market crash
- Loss of trading infrastructure

Regulatory pressure continues, and USDC is gaining ground in compliant jurisdictions. But USDT remains embedded in offshore and DeFi ecosystems. It's too systemically important to let fail.

**The Verdict:** Tether might be sketchy, but it's indispensable. It solved trading friction and created systemic risk. Whether that's a net positive remains debatable, but the market has voted with its feet.

**The lesson:** Sometimes the most controversial innovations are the most successful. Tether succeeded not because it was "better" or more decentralized, but because it solved an immediate practical problem: How do you trade crypto 24/7 without touching banks?

Nine years later, love it or hate it, USDT is crypto's most important infrastructure. And that's precisely why it's so controversial.
