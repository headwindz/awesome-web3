On August 28, 2020, the anonymous **Chef Nomi** launched **SushiSwap** and attempted DeFi's most audacious "vampire attack" by luring Uniswap liquidity with SUSHI rewards.

SushiSwap forked Uniswap's open‑source code and offered additional token incentives to liquidity providers. Users could stake their Uniswap LP tokens, earn SUSHI, and then migrate the pooled liquidity to SushiSwap. The strategy worked: over $1 billion of liquidity moved in a single migration event, temporarily gutting Uniswap.

The drama escalated when Chef Nomi sold a large portion of SUSHI, sparking accusations of an exit scam. After backlash, he returned the funds and handed control to the community, with Sam Bankman-Fried briefly coordinating the handoff. SushiSwap survived, evolved, and became a lasting DEX in its own right.

The attack also forced Uniswap to respond with its own governance token. The famous UNI airdrop arrived weeks later, pulling liquidity back and solidifying Uniswap's dominance. SushiSwap's move proved that liquidity is mercenary, incentives matter, and open‑source finance can be contested in public.
