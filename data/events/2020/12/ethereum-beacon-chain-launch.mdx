On December 1, 2020, Ethereum launched the **Beacon Chain**, the first phase of its transition from proof of work to proof of stake. It ran in parallel to mainnet for nearly two years and set the stage for **The Merge** in 2022.

The Beacon Chain introduced Ethereum's new validator‑based consensus system. Stakers deposited 32 ETH into a one‑way contract to become validators and earn rewards, with no withdrawals available until later upgrades. The launch required at least 524,288 ETH and 16,384 validators, a threshold the community met in November 2020.

Importantly, the Beacon Chain did not process regular transactions at first. It was a coordination layer, proving that the proof‑of‑stake engine worked at scale while Ethereum continued running on proof of work. It was a high‑conviction move: stakers locked up funds for months, trusting that the Merge would succeed.

The Beacon Chain signaled Ethereum's long‑term bet on energy efficiency and economic finality. It was the quiet but critical first step toward the largest protocol upgrade in crypto history.
