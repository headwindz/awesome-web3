The summer of 2020 was DeFi's breakout season, turning Ethereum into a parallel financial system for lending, trading, and yield generation without banks or brokers.

The spark was **liquidity mining**. When Compound began distributing COMP to users, yields surged and capital flooded into DeFi protocols. Users supplied assets, borrowed against them, and cycled positions to farm governance tokens. The results were explosive: total value locked jumped from around $1 billion in June to roughly $9 billion by September.

Uniswap, Aave, Yearn, and Curve became household names in crypto. Automated market makers replaced order books. Flash loans enabled new arbitrage strategies. Yield aggregators optimized returns across protocols. The idea of "money legos" became real as smart contracts composed with each other in complex, often fragile ways.

The boom came with costs. Gas fees spiked, smart contract risks multiplied, and many users learned hard lessons about impermanent loss and liquidation cascades. Still, DeFi Summer proved that open, permissionless finance could attract real demand and scale quickly. It was chaotic, experimental, and wildly profitable for some, but it permanently changed the trajectory of Ethereum and the broader crypto economy.
