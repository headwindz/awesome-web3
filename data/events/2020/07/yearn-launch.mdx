On July 17, 2020, **Andre Cronje** launched **Yearn Finance** and its token **YFI** with a true fair launch: no premine, no VC allocation, and no founder rewards. The token surged from near zero to tens of thousands of dollars within weeks, and the project became a DeFi legend.

Yearn solved a simple but painful problem: yield farming was complex, gas‑intensive, and required constant monitoring. Yearn vaults automated the process, moving user funds to the best yields across protocols and batching transactions to reduce costs. It turned DeFi farming into a one‑click experience.

The fair launch model made Yearn culturally iconic. Cronje famously said, "YFI has zero value. Don't buy it. Earn it." Users could only earn YFI by providing liquidity. That distribution created strong community ownership and made YFI a symbol of decentralized governance done right. The token briefly traded above Bitcoin, fueling the "1 YFI = 1 BTC" meme.

Yearn's success triggered a wave of copycats, many of which failed, but it proved that fair launch tokenomics could build trust and momentum. In a summer full of hype, Yearn delivered both a working product and a new standard for community ownership.
