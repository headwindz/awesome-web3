On March 28, 2024, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for fraud tied to FTX and Alameda Research. The sentence followed his 2023 conviction on multiple counts and closed the most dramatic chapter of the 2022 exchange collapse.

The court cited the scale of customer losses, misuse of funds, and lack of remorse. The ruling reinforced a clear message to the industry: innovation does not excuse custodial fraud.

Why it mattered:

- It set a high profile deterrent for centralized exchange misconduct.
- It intensified pressure for segregation of customer funds.
- It reinforced the post FTX push for audits and proof of reserves.
