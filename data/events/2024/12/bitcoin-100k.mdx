On December 4, 2024, Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time, marking a symbolic milestone after years of volatility and skepticism. The move capped a year driven by ETF inflows, the April halving, and a friendlier political backdrop.

Why it mattered:

- It validated Bitcoin as a mainstream institutional asset.
- It highlighted the impact of ETF demand on supply dynamics.
- It became a cultural milestone for the broader crypto narrative.
