In September 2024, Telegram's TON ecosystem surged as tap to earn games went viral. Millions of Telegram users created wallets and transacted on chain, giving TON one of the largest onboarding waves in crypto.

The growth was driven by frictionless distribution inside Telegram and simple gameplay loops that rewarded participation. Critics questioned whether the activity would persist after airdrops, but the experiment proved how powerful Web2 distribution can be for Web3 adoption.

Why it mattered:

- It showed that mainstream onboarding can happen inside a messaging app.
- It validated gaming and rewards as a bridge to crypto usage.
- It positioned TON as a serious consumer scale chain.
