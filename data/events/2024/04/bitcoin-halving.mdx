On April 20, 2024, Bitcoin's fourth halving cut the block subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. The scheduled supply shock reduced new issuance to about 450 BTC per day.

The 2024 halving stood out because it arrived just as spot Bitcoin ETFs were accumulating coins, tightening supply at the same time new institutional demand was rising. Miner economics tightened further, making efficiency and fee revenue more important than ever.

Why it mattered:

- Bitcoin's inflation rate dropped below 1 percent.
- ETF demand amplified the post halving supply squeeze.
- The event reinforced Bitcoin's predictable, scarce issuance narrative.
