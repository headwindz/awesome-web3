On April 30, 2024, Hong Kong approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, giving Asia its first major crypto ETF market and allowing in kind creation plus Ethereum staking features. Trading volumes were modest, but the move carried outsized symbolic weight.

Hong Kong positioned itself as a regulated gateway after mainland China's ban, and it moved ahead of the U.S. on Ethereum spot ETFs. That innovation, even with smaller volumes, added pressure on other jurisdictions to move faster.

Why it mattered:

- It created Asia's first spot crypto ETF market.
- It set a precedent for Ethereum ETFs with staking.
- It hinted at a controlled, Hong Kong first approach to regional crypto access.
