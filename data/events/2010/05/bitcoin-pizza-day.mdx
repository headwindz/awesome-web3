On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz turned a geeky experiment into dinner by paying **10,000 BTC** for two Papa John's pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida. The transaction was simple, almost casual, but it proved a radical point: Bitcoin could buy something in the real world.

## The Transaction

- **Cost**: 10,000 BTC (~$41 at the time)
- **Current value**: Over $1 billion at today's prices
- **Exchange rate**: $0.0041 per BTC
- **Pizzas**: Two large Papa John's pizzas

Another Bitcoin user, Jeremy Sturdivant ("jercos"), accepted the offer on the BitcoinTalk forum and ordered the pizzas using his credit card, receiving the 10,000 BTC as payment.

## Cultural Impact

This transaction proved Bitcoin could function as a **medium of exchange**, not just a speculative digital asset. It demonstrated that someone would actually accept Bitcoin for goods, validating Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of "peer-to-peer electronic cash."

The crypto community now celebrates **Bitcoin Pizza Day** every May 22nd, often with pizza parties and special promotions at Bitcoin-accepting establishments. Laszlo has no regrets, stating: _"I think that [if I] hadn't done it, somebody else would have... It wasn't like Bitcoin would have gotten stuck if I didn't buy those pizzas."_
