On June 15, 2023, BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that signaled serious institutional intent. With a long history of successful ETF approvals, the filing shifted expectations across the market.

Why it mattered:

- The application included a surveillance sharing structure that other issuers adopted.
- A wave of major firms followed with their own filings.
- Bitcoin rallied on expectations of eventual approval.

The filing did not guarantee approval on its own, but it marked a turning point in Wall Street's posture toward Bitcoin.
