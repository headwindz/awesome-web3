By December 2023, Solana had staged a dramatic recovery from the FTX era. SOL rebounded from the low teens to above $100, and onchain activity surged as builders and users returned.

The comeback was driven by a steady developer community, new infrastructure work like the Firedancer client, and fresh demand from DeFi, NFTs, and memecoin trading. Solana's low fees and high throughput made it a natural home for high volume retail activity.

Why it mattered:

- It showed that a chain can outlive the collapse of its biggest backer.
- Usage and developer momentum proved more durable than headlines.
- The rebound reestablished Solana as a top tier smart contract platform.
