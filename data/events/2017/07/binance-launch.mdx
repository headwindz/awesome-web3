On July 14, 2017, **Changpeng Zhao (CZ)** launched **Binance**, a fast new exchange funded by a $15 million ICO. In a matter of months, it became the world's largest by volume, powered by a slick product, aggressive listings, and a perfectly timed China exchange ban.

Binance's ICO sold 100 million BNB tokens at about $0.10 each, positioning BNB as a fee discount token that encouraged loyalty. The exchange shipped quickly, with a fast matching engine, mobile-first UX, and a broad set of trading pairs. It launched during peak ICO mania, when demand for new token listings was insatiable.

Two months later, China ordered domestic exchanges to shut down. Binance, operating offshore and already global, became an immediate refuge for displaced Chinese traders. The timing could not have been better. As Bitcoin and altcoins surged through late 2017, Binance's volume exploded. By early 2018, it was the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Binance expanded beyond spot trading into futures, lending, token launches, and its own blockchain ecosystem. BNB evolved from a discount token into the native asset of BNB Chain, with a massive market cap in later cycles. At its peak, Binance served more than 100 million users and handled a significant share of global crypto volume.

The rise was not without controversy. Binance's rapid growth outpaced regulatory clarity in many jurisdictions, leading to investigations and restrictions across multiple countries. In 2023, U.S. authorities reached a major settlement with Binance, and CZ stepped down as CEO. Even so, Binance's origin story remains one of crypto's fastest scale-ups: a startup that caught a global wave and reshaped how the world trades digital assets.
