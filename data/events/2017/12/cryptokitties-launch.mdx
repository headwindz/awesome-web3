On December 2, 2017, **CryptoKitties** went viral, clogging Ethereum and proving that digital collectibles could be valuable. The playful cat craze foreshadowed the NFT boom that would erupt a few years later.

CryptoKitties let users buy, breed, and trade unique digital cats represented as **ERC-721 NFTs**. Each cat had a genetic code that produced new traits when bred. The game was simple, accessible, and addictive, attracting a wave of users beyond the usual crypto crowd.

Within days, CryptoKitties dominated Ethereum traffic. Network congestion surged, fees spiked, and thousands of transactions piled up. At peak mania, CryptoKitties accounted for a significant share of all Ethereum activity, a shockingly large load for a network that could only process about 15 transactions per second. The sudden strain became a public wake-up call: Ethereum needed to scale.

Some cats sold for hundreds of ETH, with the famous "Dragon" cat fetching around 600 ETH at the time. The creators, Axiom Zen (later spinning out **Dapper Labs**), earned millions in fees and validated the business model for NFT marketplaces and digital collectibles.

CryptoKitties didn't last as a mainstream game, but its impact was lasting. It popularized NFTs, standardized ERC-721 usage, and showed that culture and scarcity could create real value on-chain. It also pushed the industry toward Layer 2 scaling and better user experience. In hindsight, the cats were a preview of the NFT explosion to come.
