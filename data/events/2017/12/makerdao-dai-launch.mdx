On December 18, 2017, **MakerDAO** launched **DAI**, the first decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. It offered a transparent alternative to centralized stablecoins and quickly became a cornerstone of DeFi.

DAI's model was simple but powerful: users lock ETH into Maker vaults (then called CDPs) and mint DAI against it at a minimum 150% collateralization ratio. If the collateral falls too low, the system liquidates it to keep DAI near $1. A stability fee (paid in MKR) and governance-controlled parameters help maintain the peg.

At launch, DAI was small and experimental, but it solved a critical problem. Tether dominated stablecoins with opaque reserves, and trustless alternatives didn't exist. DAI provided on-chain transparency, censorship resistance, and a stable unit of account for DeFi protocols. Once lending markets and AMMs emerged, DAI became the default base asset for a large part of the ecosystem.

MakerDAO evolved over time. In 2019 it introduced Multi-Collateral DAI, adding new collateral types beyond ETH. In March 2020, "Black Thursday" stress-tested the system when ETH crashed and gas prices spiked, creating bad debt that Maker covered through MKR dilution. The system survived, and governance tightened risk controls.

DAI's launch marked the birth of decentralized stablecoin infrastructure. It proved that a stable asset could be maintained by code and incentives rather than a centralized issuer, and it helped unlock the DeFi boom that followed.
