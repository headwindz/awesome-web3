On March 10, 2017, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin ETF proposal, delaying the era of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs by years. The decision cited concerns about market manipulation and unregulated trading venues. Bitcoin dropped sharply on the news, then recovered within weeks, but the rejection set a precedent that would hold until 2024.

The twins first filed in 2013, envisioning a physically backed Bitcoin trust that would trade on a public exchange and give traditional investors easy access through brokerage accounts. They compared it to the 2004 gold ETF launch that unlocked massive inflows. In 2017, the SEC was not convinced the underlying Bitcoin market had adequate surveillance or protections against manipulation, and it declined the application.

The market reaction was immediate: Bitcoin fell roughly 28% intraday from around $1,350 to below $1,000, then recovered as buyers stepped in. The bigger impact was regulatory. For the next seven years, the SEC rejected or delayed every spot Bitcoin ETF attempt, keeping a wall between traditional capital markets and direct Bitcoin exposure.

That stance softened only after a series of events reshaped the landscape. In 2021, the SEC approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs while still rejecting spot products, a distinction that frustrated the industry. In 2023, Grayscale won a court case arguing the SEC was inconsistent in its reasoning. In January 2024, the SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs at once, finally opening the institutional onramp the Winklevoss twins had asked for years earlier.

The Winklevoss rejection is remembered as both a cautionary tale and a long-term vindication. The twins were early, and early looked like wrong. But the core thesis proved accurate: institutional access mattered, and once it arrived, it drew significant inflows. The seven-year wait shaped where capital flowed, where companies built, and how quickly the U.S. market embraced Bitcoin as an investable asset.
