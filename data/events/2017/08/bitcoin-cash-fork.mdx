On August 1, 2017, **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)** split from Bitcoin after years of bitter scaling debates. The fork created two versions of Bitcoin, divided the community, and set a precedent for resolving irreconcilable disputes: fork it and let the market decide.

The conflict centered on Bitcoin's 1MB block size limit. As usage grew, fees surged and confirmation times worsened, making small payments painful. One camp pushed for bigger blocks and on-chain scaling, arguing Bitcoin should remain peer-to-peer cash. The other camp insisted on keeping blocks small to preserve decentralization and pushing scaling to second layers like Lightning.

After failed compromise attempts and a highly polarized debate, the big-block faction launched Bitcoin Cash with 8MB blocks. Anyone holding Bitcoin received the same amount of BCH, creating an instant rival chain. Bitcoin kept the BTC ticker and most of the developer ecosystem. BCH gained strong support from miners aligned with Bitmain and vocal advocates like Roger Ver.

For a time, BCH thrived. It traded from a few hundred dollars to nearly $4,000 during the 2017 bull run. But the split exposed deep governance challenges. In 2018, Bitcoin Cash itself fractured into BCH and BSV after another internal power struggle. Market share declined, developer activity slowed, and Bitcoin Cash gradually lost relevance as Bitcoin retained its network effects.

The fork's legacy is more about governance than price. It proved that Bitcoin's conservatism is a feature, not a bug: major changes require near-unanimous consensus. When that consensus can't be reached, forks are the escape valve. Bitcoin Cash preserved a vision of Bitcoin as everyday cash. Bitcoin doubled down on the store-of-value narrative. The market chose BTC, but the fork permanently etched the scaling wars into crypto history.
