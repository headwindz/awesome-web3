On August 24, 2017, **Segregated Witness (SegWit)** activated on Bitcoin at block **#481,824**. The upgrade ended years of blocksize fights, increased effective capacity, fixed transaction malleability, and opened the door for Layer 2 systems like Lightning.

SegWit changed how Bitcoin transactions are structured by separating signatures from the main transaction data. This effectively increased block capacity to roughly 2-4MB without a hard fork, and it introduced a discount for signature data that reduced fees for SegWit users. Just as important, it fixed transaction malleability, a long-standing bug that made Lightning Network impossible to build safely.

The path to activation was political as much as technical. By 2017, miner support for SegWit had stalled, and users threatened a **User Activated Soft Fork (UASF)** to force the upgrade. A compromise known as **BIP91** lowered the activation threshold and avoided a chain split, enabling SegWit to lock in. It was a rare moment where users, miners, and businesses aligned under pressure.

SegWit did not end debate entirely, but it proved Bitcoin could upgrade without sacrificing decentralization. Adoption was slow at first, then steady. By 2024, most Bitcoin transactions use SegWit, and the Lightning Network operates as a viable payments layer for small, fast transfers. The upgrade became a defining milestone: Bitcoin chose a conservative path, prioritized node decentralization, and scaled through layers rather than simply enlarging blocks.
