On March 11, 2021, digital artist **Beeple** sold the NFT "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" for **$69.3 million** at Christie's, instantly becoming one of the most expensive living artists. The sale flipped NFTs from crypto curiosity to mainstream cultural moment.

The artwork was a massive collage of 5,000 daily images created over 13 years. Christie's accepted crypto payment and minted the piece as an ERC-721 NFT on Ethereum. The buyer, Vignesh Sundaresan (MetaKovan), paid $69,346,250 after a dramatic bidding war.

The sale ignited a wave of NFT adoption. Major auction houses rushed in, celebrities launched collections, and the NFT market exploded into the tens of billions in annual volume. It also sparked criticism around speculation, environmental impact, and intellectual property, but the cultural shift was irreversible.

Beeple's sale proved that digital ownership could command traditional art-market prices. It was the moment NFTs broke into the mainstream and set the tone for the 2021 mania that followed.
