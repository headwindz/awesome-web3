On November 14, 2021, **Taproot** activated on Bitcoin at block **#709,632**, bringing **Schnorr signatures**, improved privacy, and more efficient smart contracts. It was the most significant Bitcoin upgrade since SegWit.

Taproot made complex transactions look like simple ones, improving privacy and saving block space. Schnorr signatures enabled signature aggregation, reducing transaction size and paving the way for better multi‑sig and Lightning workflows. The upgrade also introduced Tapscript, making future Bitcoin scripting improvements easier.

The activation was notable for its smoothness. After years of controversy around SegWit, Taproot achieved broad consensus and activated without drama. Adoption was gradual, but it laid the foundation for future upgrades and new use cases such as Ordinals in 2023.

Taproot reinforced Bitcoin's conservative but steady approach to innovation: slow, carefully reviewed changes that improve privacy, efficiency, and long‑term scalability without sacrificing decentralization.
