On February 8, 2021, **Tesla** disclosed it bought **$1.5 billion in Bitcoin** and planned to accept BTC for cars. Bitcoin jumped to new highs and the announcement became a legitimacy milestone for corporate adoption. Three months later, Elon Musk reversed course, citing environmental concerns, and the market sold off sharply.

Tesla's SEC filing said the company had updated its treasury policy and invested roughly $1.5 billion in Bitcoin at an average price around $34,000. The news sent BTC from roughly $39,000 to $48,000 within hours and fueled the early 2021 bull run narrative that Bitcoin was now a corporate treasury asset, not just a retail speculation.

In May, Tesla suspended Bitcoin payments, arguing mining was too fossil-fuel heavy. The tweet triggered an immediate market drop and amplified ESG concerns across institutions. Tesla said it would reconsider when mining used more renewable energy, but the reversal exposed how fragile sentiment still was and how much a single celebrity CEO could move the market.

The episode had lasting impact. It accelerated the energy debate, pushed miners toward renewable narratives, and reminded markets that institutional adoption was still shaped by public perception and politics as much as by fundamentals.
