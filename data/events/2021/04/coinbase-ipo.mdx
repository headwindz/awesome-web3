On April 14, 2021, **Coinbase** listed on the NASDAQ under ticker **COIN** via a direct listing, becoming the first major crypto exchange to go public. The debut valued the company around **$85 billion** and marked a watershed moment for crypto's relationship with traditional finance.

The listing arrived at peak bull‑market euphoria. Bitcoin had just touched $64,000, NFT mania was exploding, and Coinbase reported blockbuster Q1 results: about $1.8 billion in revenue and over 56 million verified users. The stock opened at $381, briefly hit $429, and closed around $328.

The IPO legitimized crypto as a public‑market asset class and forced Wall Street to treat crypto infrastructure as a serious business. It also introduced new scrutiny. Coinbase's revenue proved highly cyclical, and its stock later fell sharply during the 2022 bear market before recovering with the next cycle.

Regardless of price swings, the listing symbolized crypto's coming‑of‑age: a once‑fringe exchange entering the heart of public markets.
