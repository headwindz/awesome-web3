On April 30, 2021, **Yuga Labs** launched the **Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)**, a collection of 10,000 NFT apes that became the most culturally powerful project in the NFT era. Minted at **0.08 ETH**, the collection sold out slowly at first, then turned into a global status symbol.

BAYC added something CryptoPunks did not: community and utility. Holders received commercial rights to their apes, access to exclusive events, and a roadmap of future drops. Celebrity adoption followed quickly, and ape profile pictures became a marker of crypto status. Floor prices surged from a few hundred dollars to six-figure territory at the peak.

The project became a franchise. Yuga Labs expanded with Mutant Apes, airdrops, ApeCoin, and an ambitious metaverse called Otherside. The model defined the NFT playbook: community first, strong branding, and tokenized perks.

BAYC also drew criticism for hype, speculation, and celebrity marketing. But regardless of sentiment, it established NFTs as cultural assets and proved that digital communities could create real-world brand power.
