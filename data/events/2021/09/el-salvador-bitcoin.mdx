On September 7, 2021, **El Salvador** became the first country to adopt **Bitcoin as legal tender** alongside the U.S. dollar. President Nayib Bukele's government launched the **Chivo** wallet and gave citizens $30 in BTC to encourage adoption.

The policy aimed to reduce remittance costs, expand financial inclusion, and position the country as a crypto innovation hub. Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte served as the pilot, and Lightning Network payments powered low‑fee transactions. The government also announced ambitious plans for Bitcoin bonds and geothermal mining.

The rollout was rocky. The Chivo app suffered glitches, many users cashed out to dollars immediately, and critics warned about volatility and IMF negotiations. Still, the experiment proved that a nation‑state could integrate Bitcoin into its monetary system, even if adoption was uneven.

El Salvador's move remains one of the most ambitious real‑world tests of Bitcoin's utility as money. It continues to shape global discussions about crypto policy, sovereign adoption, and the role of digital assets in emerging economies.
