On August 5, 2021, Ethereum activated **EIP-1559** in the London hard fork, transforming how transaction fees work. The upgrade introduced an algorithmic base fee that gets **burned**, making ETH supply shrink during periods of high activity.

Before EIP-1559, Ethereum fees were a chaotic auction. Users routinely overpaid and fees were unpredictable. EIP-1559 replaced that with a base fee that adjusts each block and a small priority tip for validators. The result was more stable fees and a direct value‑capture mechanism for ETH holders.

The burn quickly became significant. In busy periods, Ethereum destroyed more ETH than it issued, fueling the "ultrasound money" narrative. The upgrade also laid groundwork for the 2022 Merge, which drastically reduced issuance and made deflation more common.

EIP-1559 was both technical and cultural. It improved user experience, altered Ethereum's monetary policy, and gave the network a new economic story centered on scarcity driven by usage.
