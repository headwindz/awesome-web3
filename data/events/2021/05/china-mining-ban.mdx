On May 21, 2021, China announced a sweeping crackdown on Bitcoin mining, triggering the largest hash rate migration in crypto history. Within months, most of the network's computing power moved out of China, ending its long‑held dominance.

At the time, China controlled roughly 65-75% of global hash rate. Provincial governments ordered mining operations to shut down, citing energy consumption, financial risk, and carbon targets. Farms in Sichuan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other regions powered down almost simultaneously.

Hash rate fell by more than 50% and Bitcoin's price dropped sharply, but the network kept producing blocks as difficulty adjusted. Miners shipped millions of ASICs to new hubs in the United States, Kazakhstan, Canada, and other regions. By early 2022, the hash rate had fully recovered and the geographic distribution was far more diversified.

The ban backfired in a strange way. It made Bitcoin more decentralized by removing a single‑country concentration risk. The forced migration proved the network could survive severe shocks and still function as designed.
